##  Lexical Conventions {#GUID-D9AEB31A-8584-4066-85D0-AF6EFA609381} 

The following lexical conventions for issuing SQL statements apply specifically to the Oracle Database implementation of SQL, but are generally acceptable in other SQL implementations. 

When you issue a SQL statement, you can include one or more tabs, carriage returns, spaces, or comments anywhere a space occurs within the definition of the statement. Thus, Oracle Database evaluates the following two statements in the same manner: 
    
    
    ```
    SELECT last_name,salary*12,MONTHS_BETWEEN(SYSDATE,hire_date) 
      FROM employees
      WHERE department_id = 30
      ORDER BY last_name;
    
    SELECT last_name,
      salary * 12,
            MONTHS_BETWEEN( SYSDATE, hire_date )
    FROM employees
    WHERE department_id=30
    ORDER BY last_name;
    
    ```

Case is insignificant in reserved words, keywords, identifiers, and parameters. However, case is significant in text literals and quoted names. Refer to [ Text Literals ](Literals.md#GUID-1824CBAA-6E16-4921-B2A6-112FB02248DA) for a syntax description of text literals. 

> **note:** 

SQL statements are terminated differently in different programming environments. This documentation set uses the default SQL*Plus character, the semicolon (;).
