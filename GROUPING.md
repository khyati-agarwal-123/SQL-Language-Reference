## GROUPING

Syntax

![Description of grouping.eps

[Description of the illustration grouping.eps](img_text/grouping.md)

Purpose

`GROUPING` distinguishes superaggregate rows from regular grouped rows.
`GROUP` `BY` extensions such as `ROLLUP` and `CUBE` produce superaggregate
rows where the set of all values is represented by null. Using the `GROUPING`
function, you can distinguish a null representing the set of all values in a
superaggregate row from a null in a regular row.

The `expr` in the `GROUPING` function must match one of the expressions in the
`GROUP` `BY` clause. The function returns a value of 1 if the value of `expr`
in the row is a null representing the set of all values. Otherwise, it returns
zero. The data type of the value returned by the `GROUPING` function is Oracle
`NUMBER`. Refer to the `SELECT` [group_by_clause](SELECT.md#GUID-
CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__I2182483) for a discussion of these
terms.

Examples

In the following example, which uses the sample tables `hr.departments` and
`hr.employees`, if the `GROUPING` function returns 1 (indicating a
superaggregate row rather than a regular row from the table), then the string
"All Jobs" appears in the "JOB" column instead of the null that would
otherwise appear:

    
    
    SELECT 
        DECODE(GROUPING(department_name), 1, 'ALL DEPARTMENTS', department_name)
          AS department,
        DECODE(GROUPING(job_id), 1, 'All Jobs', job_id) AS job,
        COUNT(*) "Total Empl",
        AVG(salary) * 12 "Average Sal"
      FROM employees e, departments d
      WHERE d.department_id = e.department_id
      GROUP BY ROLLUP (department_name, job_id)
      ORDER BY department, job;
    
    DEPARTMENT                     JOB        Total Empl Average Sal
