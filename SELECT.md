## SELECT

Purpose

Use a `SELECT` statement or subquery to retrieve data from one or more tables,
object tables, views, object views, materialized views, analytic views, or
hierarchies.

If part or all of the result of a `SELECT` statement is equivalent to an
existing materialized view, then Oracle Database may use the materialized view
in place of one or more tables specified in the `SELECT` statement. This
substitution is called query rewrite. It takes place only if cost optimization
is enabled and the `QUERY_REWRITE_ENABLED` parameter is set to `TRUE`. To
determine whether query rewrite has occurred, use the `EXPLAIN` `PLAN`
statement.

Prerequisites

For you to select data from a table, materialized view, analytic view, or
hierarchy, the object must be in your own schema or you must have the `READ`
or `SELECT` privilege on the table, materialized view, analytic view, or
hierarchy.

For you to select rows from the base tables of a view:

  * The object must be in your own schema or you must have the `READ` or `SELECT` privilege on it, and 

  * Whoever owns the schema containing the object must have the `READ` or `SELECT` privilege on the base tables. 

The `READ` `ANY` `TABLE` or `SELECT` `ANY` `TABLE` system privilege also
allows you to select data from any table, materialized view, analytic view, or
hierarchy, or the base table of any materialized view, analytic view, or
hierarchy.

To specify the `FOR` `UPDATE` clause, the preceding prerequisites apply with
the following exception: The `READ` and `READ` `ANY` `TABLE` privileges, where
mentioned, do not allow you to specify the `FOR` `UPDATE` clause.

To issue an Oracle Flashback Query using the `flashback_query_clause`, you
must have the `READ` or `SELECT` privilege on the objects in the select list.
In addition, either you must have `FLASHBACK` object privilege on the objects
in the select list, or you must have `FLASHBACK` `ANY` `TABLE` system
privilege.

Semantics

with_clause

Use the `with_clause` to define the following:

  * PL/SQL procedures and functions (using the `plsql_declarations` clause) 

  * Subquery blocks (using `subquery_factoring_clause` or `subav_factoring_clause`, or both) 

plsql_declarations

The `plsql_declarations` clause lets you declare and define PL/SQL functions
and procedures. You can then reference the PL/SQL functions in the query in
which you specify this clause, as well as its subqueries, if any. For the
purposes of name resolution, these function names have precedence over schema-
level stored functions.

If the query in which you specify this clause is not a top-level `SELECT`
statement, then the following rules apply to the top-level SQL statement that
contains the query:

  * If the top-level statement is a `SELECT` statement, then it must have either a `WITH` `plsql_declarations` clause or the `WITH_PLSQL` hint. 

  * If the top-level statement is a `DELETE`, `MERGE`, `INSERT`, or `UPDATE` statement, then it must have the `WITH_PLSQL` hint. 

The `WITH_PLSQL` hint only enables you to specify the `WITH`
`plsql_declarations` clause within the statement. It is not an optimizer hint.

See Also:

  * Oracle Database PL/SQL Language Reference for syntax and restrictions for [`function_declaration`](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/sqlrf&id=LNPLS01322) and [`procedure_declaration`](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/sqlrf&id=LNPLS01336). 

  * "[Using a PL/SQL Function in the WITH Clause: Examples](SELECT.md#GUID-CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__BABJFIDC)"

subquery_factoring_clause

The `subquery_factoring_clause` lets you assign a name (`query_name`) to a
subquery block. You can then reference the subquery block multiple places in
the query by specifying `query_name`. Oracle Database optimizes the query by
treating the `query_name` as either an inline view or as a temporary table.
The `query_name` is subject to the same naming conventions and restrictions as
database schema objects. Refer to "[Database Object Naming Rules](Database-
Object-Names-and-Qualifiers.md#GUID-75337742-67FD-4EC0-985F-741C93D918DA)"
for information on database object names.

The column aliases following the `query_name` and the set operators separating
multiple subqueries in the `AS` clause are valid and required for recursive
subquery factoring. The `search_clause` and `cycle_clause` are valid only for
recursive subquery factoring but are not required. See "[Recursive Subquery
Factoring](SELECT.md#GUID-CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__BCEJGIBG)".

You can specify this clause in any top-level `SELECT` statement and in most
types of subqueries. The query name is visible to the main query and to all
subsequent subqueries. For recursive subquery factoring, the query name is
even visible to the subquery that defines the query name itself.

Recursive Subquery Factoring

If a `subquery_factoring_clause` refers to its own `query_name` in the
subquery that defines it, then the `subquery_factoring_clause` is said to be
recursive. A recursive `subquery_factoring_clause` must contain two query
blocks: the first is the anchor member and the second is the recursive member.
The anchor member must appear before the recursive member, and it cannot
reference `query_name`. The anchor member can be composed of one or more query
blocks combined by the set operators: `UNION` `ALL`, `UNION`, `INTERSECT` or
`MINUS`. The recursive member must follow the anchor member and must reference
`query_name` exactly once. You must combine the recursive member with the
anchor member using the `UNION` `ALL` set operator.

The number of column aliases following `WITH` `query_name` and the number of
columns in the `SELECT` lists of the anchor and recursive query blocks must be
the same.

The recursive member cannot contain any of the following elements:

  * The `DISTINCT` keyword or a `GROUP` `BY` clause 

  * The `model_clause`

  * An aggregate function. However, analytic functions are permitted in the select list.

  * Subqueries that refer to `query_name`. 

  * Outer joins that refer to `query_name` as the right table. 

In previous releases of Oracle Database, the recursive member of a recursive
`WITH` clause ran serially regardless of the parallelism of the entire query
(also known as the top-level `SELECT` statement). Beginning with Oracle
Database 12c Release 2 (12.2), the recursive member runs in parallel if the
optimizer determines that the top-level `SELECT` statement can be executed in
parallel.

search_clause

Use the `SEARCH` clause to specify an ordering for the rows.

  * Specify `BREADTH` `FIRST` `BY` if you want sibling rows returned before any child rows are returned. 

  * Specify `DEPTH` `FIRST` `BY` if you want child rows returned before any siblings rows are returned. 

  * Sibling rows are ordered by the columns listed after the `BY` keyword. 

  * The `c_alias` list following the `SEARCH` keyword must contain column names from the column alias list for `query_name`. 

  * The `ordering_column` is automatically added to the column list for the query name. The query that selects from `query_name` can include an `ORDER` `BY` on `ordering_column` to return the rows in the order that was specified by the `SEARCH` clause. 

cycle_clause

Use the `CYCLE` clause to mark cycles in the recursion.

  * The `c_alias` list following the `CYCLE` keyword must contain column names from the column alias list for `query_name`. Oracle Database uses these columns to detect a cycle. 

  * `cycle_value` and `no_cycle_value` should be character strings of length 1. 

  * If a cycle is detected, then the cycle mark column specified by `cycle_mark_c_alias` for the row causing the cycle is set to the value specified for `cycle_value`. The recursion will then stop for this row. That is, it will not look for child rows for the offending row, but it will continue for other noncyclic rows. 

  * If no cycles are found, then the cycle mark column is set to the default value specified for `no_cycle_value`. 

  * The cycle mark column is automatically added to the column list for the `query_name`. 

  * A row is considered to form a cycle if one of its ancestor rows has the same values for the cycle columns.

If you omit the `CYCLE` clause, then the recursive `WITH` clause returns an
error if cycles are discovered. In this case, a row forms a cycle if one of
its ancestor rows has the same values for all the columns in the column alias
list for `query_name` that are referenced in the `WHERE` clause of the
recursive member.

Restrictions on Subquery Factoring

This clause is subject to the following restrictions:

  * You can specify only one `subquery_factoring_clause` in a single SQL statement. Any `query_name` defined in the `subquery_factoring_clause` can be used in any subsequent named query block in the `subquery_factoring_clause`. 

  * In a compound query with set operators, you cannot use the `query_name` for any of the component queries, but you can use the `query_name` in the `FROM` clause of any of the component queries. 

  * You cannot specify duplicate names in the column alias list for `query_name`. 

  * The name used for the `ordering_column` has to be different from the name used for `cycle_mark_c_alias`. 

  * The `ordering_column` and cycle mark column names cannot already be in the column alias list for `query_name`. 

See Also:

  * [Oracle Database Concepts](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/sqlrf&id=CNCPT010) for information about inline views

  * "[Recursive Subquery Factoring: Examples](SELECT.md#GUID-CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__BABCDJDB)"

subav_factoring_clause

With the `subav_factoring_clause`, you can define a transitory analytic view
that filters fact data prior to aggregation or adds calculated measures to a
query of an analytic view. The `subav_name` argument assigns a name to the
transitory analytic view. You can then reference the transitory analytic view
multiple places in the query by specifying `subav_name`. The `subav_name` is
subject to the same naming conventions and restrictions as database schema
objects. Refer to "[Database Object Naming Rules](Database-Object-Names-and-
Qualifiers.md#GUID-75337742-67FD-4EC0-985F-741C93D918DA)" for information on
database object names.

You can specify this clause in any top-level `SELECT` statement and in most
types of subqueries. The query name is visible to the main query and to all
subsequent subqueries.

The `sub_av_clause` argument defines a transitory analytic view.

sub_av_clause

With the `USING` keyword, specify the name of an analytic view, which may be a
transitory analytic view previously defined in the `WITH` clause or it may be
a persistent analytic view. A persistent analytic view is defined in a
`CREATE` `ANALYTIC` `VIEW` statement. If the analytic view is a persistent
one, then the current user must have select access on it.

See Also:

[Analytic Views: Examples](SELECT.md#GUID-
CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__P-1314421-F3347731)

hierarchies_clause

The `hierarchies_clause` specifies the hierarchies of the base analytic view
that the results of the transitory analytic view are dimensioned by. With the
`HIERARCHIES` keyword, specify the alias of one or more hierarchies of the
base analytic view.

If you do not specify a `HIERARCHIES` clause, then the default hierarchies of
the base analytic view are used.

filter_clauses

You may specify a given `hier_alias` in at most one `filter_clause`.

filter_clause

The filter clause applies the specified predicate condition to the fact table,
which reduces the number of rows returned from the table before aggregation of
the measure values. The predicate may contain any SQL row function or
operation. The predicate may refer to any attribute of the specified hierarchy
or it may refer to a measure of the analytic view if you specify the
`MEASURES` keyword.

For example, the following clause restricts the aggregation of measure values
to those for the first and second quarters of every year of a time hierarchy.

    
    
    FILTER FACT (time_hier TO quarter_of_year IN (1,2))

If you then select from the transitory analytic view the sales for the years
2000 and 2001, the values returned are the aggregated values of the first and
second quarters only.

An example of specifying a predicate for a measure in the filter clause is the
following.

    
    
    FILTER FACT (MEASURES TO sales BETWEEN 100 AND 200)

attr_dim_alias

The alias of an attribute dimension in the base analytic view. The
`USER_ANALYTIC_VIEW_DIMENSIONS` view contains the aliases of the attribute
dimensions in an analytic view.

hier_alias

The alias of a hierarchy in the base analytic view. The
`USER_ANALYTIC_VIEW_HIERS` view contains the aliases of the hierarchies in an
analytic view.

add_meas_clause

With the `ADD` `MEASURES` keywords, you may add calculated measures to the
transitory analytic view.

calc_meas_clause

Specify a name for the calculated measure and an analytic view expression that
specifies values for the calculated measure. The analytic view expression can
be any valid `calc_meas_expression` as described in [Analytic View
Expressions](analytic-view-measure-
expressions.md#GUID-F8C7ED67-A4EC-479C-975F-12F1F4B8CBA0 "You can use
analytic view expressions to create calculated measures within the definition
of an analytic view or in a query that selects from an analytic view."). For
example, the following adds a calculated measure named âshare_sales.â

    
    
    ADD MEASURES (share_sales AS (SHARE_OF(sales HIERARCHY time_hier PARENT)))

hint

Specify a comment that passes instructions to the optimizer on choosing an
execution plan for the statement.

syntax and description of hints

DISTINCT | UNIQUE

Specify `DISTINCT` or `UNIQUE` if you want the database to return only one
copy of each set of duplicate rows selected. These two keywords are
synonymous. Duplicate rows are those with matching values for each expression
in the select list.

Restrictions on DISTINCT and UNIQUE Queries

These types of queries are subject to the following restrictions:

  * When you specify `DISTINCT` or `UNIQUE`, the total number of bytes in all select list expressions is limited to the size of a data block minus some overhead. This size is specified by the initialization parameter `DB_BLOCK_SIZE`. 

  * You cannot specify `DISTINCT` if the `select_list` contains LOB columns. 

ALL

Specify `ALL` if you want the database to return all rows selected, including
all copies of duplicates. The default is `ALL`.

select_list

The `select_list` lets you specify the columns you want to retrieve from the
database.

* (all-column wildcard)

Specify the all-column wildcard (asterisk) to select all columns, excluding
pseudocolumns and `INVISIBLE` columns, from all tables, views, or materialized
views listed in the `FROM` clause. The columns are returned in the order
indicated by the `COLUMN_ID` column of the `*_TAB_COLUMNS` data dictionary
view for the table, view, or materialized view.

If you are selecting from a table rather than from a view or a materialized
view, then columns that have been marked as `UNUSED` by the `ALTER` `TABLE`
`SET` `UNUSED` statement are not selected.

See Also:

[ALTER TABLE](ALTER-TABLE.md#GUID-552E7373-BF93-477D-9DA3-B2C9386F2877),

DUAL Table: Example](SELECT.md#GUID-
CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__I2130183)"

query_name.*

Specify `query_name` followed by a period and the asterisk to select all
columns from the specified subquery block. For `query_name`, specify a
subquery block name already specified in the `subquery_factoring_clause`. You
must have specified the `subquery_factoring_clause` in order to specify
`query_name` in the `select_list`. If you specify `query_name` in the
`select_list`, then you also must specify `query_name` in the
`query_table_expression` (`FROM` clause).

table.* | view.* | materialized view.*

Specify the object name followed by a period and the asterisk to select all
columns from the specified table, view, or materialized view. Oracle Database
returns a set of columns in the order in which the columns were specified when
the object was created. A query that selects rows from two or more tables,
views, or materialized views is a join.

You can use the schema qualifier to select from a table, view, or materialized
view in a schema other than your own. If you omit `schema`, then the database
assumes the table, view, or materialized view is in your own schema.

See Also:

"[Joins](Joins.md#GUID-39081984-8D38-4D64-A847-AA43F515D460)"

t_alias .*

Specify a correlation name (alias) followed by a period and the asterisk to
select all columns from the object with that correlation name specified in the
`FROM` clause of the same subquery. The object can be a table, view,
materialized view, or subquery. Oracle Database returns a set of columns in
the order in which the columns were specified when the object was created. A
query that selects rows from two or more objects is a join.

expr

Specify an expression representing the information you want to select. A
column name in this list can be qualified with `schema` only if the table,
view, or materialized view containing the column is qualified with `schema` in
the `FROM` clause. If you specify a member method of an object type, then you
must follow the method name with parentheses even if the method takes no
arguments.

The expression can also hold a scalar value that can be return values of
PL/SQL functions, subqueries that return a single value per row, and SQL
macros.

c_alias

Specify an alias for the column expression. Oracle Database will use this
alias in the column heading of the result set. The `AS` keyword is optional.
The alias effectively renames the select list item for the duration of the
query. The alias can be used in the `order_by_clause` but not other clauses in
the query.

From Release 23 you can use `c_alias` in `group_by_clause` .

See Also:

  * [Oracle Database Data Warehousing Guide](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/sqlrf&id=DWHSG080) for information on using the `expr` `AS` `c_alias` syntax with the `UNION` `ALL` operator in queries of multiple materialized views 

  * "[About SQL Expressions](About-SQL-Expressions.md#GUID-68789A5C-B142-496F-ADEE-837F75F95B2B)" for the syntax of `expr`

Restrictions on the Select List

The select list is subject to the following restrictions:

  * If you also specify a [group_by_clause](SELECT.md#GUID-CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__I2182483) in this statement, then this select list can contain only the following types of expressions: 

    * Constants 

    * Aggregate functions and the functions `USER`, `UID`, and `SYSDATE`

    * Expressions identical to those in the `group_by_clause`. If the `group_by_clause` is in a subquery, then all columns in the select list of the subquery must match the `GROUP` `BY` columns in the subquery. If the select list and `GROUP` `BY` columns of a top-level query or of a subquery do not match, then the statement results in `ORA-00979`. 

From Release 23 you can group by `position` and `alias`.

    * Expressions involving the preceding expressions that evaluate to the same value for all rows in a group 

  * You can select a rowid from a join view only if the join has one and only one key-preserved table. The rowid of that table becomes the rowid of the view. 

See Also:

[Oracle Database Administrator's
Guide](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-
database/23/sqlrf&id=ADMIN020) for information on key-preserved tables

  * If two or more tables have some column names in common, and if you are specifying a join in the `FROM` clause, then you must qualify column names with names of tables or table aliases. 

FROM Clause

Use the optional `FROM` clause to specify the objects from which data is
selected.

You can invoke a polymorphic table function (PTF) in the query block of the
`FROM` clause like other existing table functions. A PTF is a table function
whose operands can have more than one type.

With Oracle Database 21c, you can write SQL table macros and use them inside
the `FROM` clause, where it would be legal to call a PL/SQL function. SQL
table macros are expressions, typically used in a `FROM` clause, to act as a
sort of polymorphic (parameterized) views. You must define these macro
functions in PL/SQL and call them from SQL for them to function as macros.

With Oracle Database Release 23, you can use the `GRAPH_TABLE` operator as a
table expression in the `FROM` clause.

See Also:

  * [GRAPH_TABLE Operator](graph_table-operator.md#GUID-CA6A600E-2087-46F8-A081-C6F3F01CF305)

  * [ PL/SQL Optimization and Tuning](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/sqlrf&id=LNPLS-GUID-981102A8-5204-4931-B10A-93486304B184)

ONLY

The `ONLY` clause applies only to views. Specify `ONLY` if the view in the
`FROM` clause is a view belonging to a hierarchy and you do not want to
include rows from any of its subviews.

query_table_expression

Use the `query_table_expression` clause to identify a subquery block, table,
view, materialized view, analytic view, hierarchy, partition, or subpartition,
or to specify a subquery that identifies the objects. In order to specify a
subquery block, you must have specified the subquery block name (`query_name`
in the `subquery_factoring_clause` or `subav_name` in the
`subav_factoring_clause` ).

The analytic view in the expression may be a transitory analytic view defined
in the `with_clause` or a persistent analytic view.

See Also:

"[Using Subqueries: Examples](SELECT.md#GUID-
CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__I2130078)"

LATERAL

Specify `LATERAL` to designate `subquery` as a lateral inline view. Within a
lateral inline view, you can specify tables that appear to the left of the
lateral inline view in the `FROM` clause of a query. You can specify this left
correlation anywhere within `subquery` (such as the `SELECT`, `FROM`, and
`WHERE` clauses) and at any nesting level.

Restrictions on LATERAL

Lateral inline views are subject to the following restrictions:

  * If you specify `LATERAL`, then you cannot specify the `pivot_clause`, the `unpivot_clause`, or a pattern in the `table_reference` clause. 

  * If a lateral inline view contains the `query_partition_clause`, and it is the right side of a join clause, then it cannot contain a left correlation to the left table in the join clause. However, it can contain a left correlation to a table to its left in the `FROM` clause that is not the left table. 

  * A lateral inline view cannot contain a left correlation to the first table in a right outer join or full outer join.

See Also:

"[Using Lateral Inline Views: Example](SELECT.md#GUID-
CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__BABFDGIJ)"

inline_external_table

Specify this clause to inline an external table in a query. You must specify
the table columns and properties for the external table that will be inlined
in the query.

inline_external_table_properties

This clause extends the `external_table_data_props` with the `REJECT LIMIT`
and `access_driver_type` options. Use this clause to specify the properties of
the external table.

In addition to supporting external data residing in operating file systems and
Big Data sources and formats such as HDFS and Hive, Oracle supports external
data residing in objects.

modified_external_table

You can use this clause to override some external table properties specified
by the `CREATE TABLE` or `ALTER TABLE` statements from within a query.

You can override external table parameters at runtime.

Restrictions

  * You must specify the key words `EXTERNAL MODIFY` in the query. If you do not specify the keywords, you will see a `Missing or invalid option` error. 

  * You must reference an external table in the query. If you do not, you will see an error.

  * You must specify at least one property in the query. One of `DEFAULT DIRECTORY`, `LOCATION`, `ACCESS PARAMETERS`, or `REJECT LIMIT`. 

  * If you specify more than one external table properties, they must be listed in order. First the `DEFAULT DIRECTORY` must be specified, followed by the `ACCESS PARAMETERS`, `LOCATION` and `REJECT LIMIT`. Otherwise an error will be raised. 

  * In the `DEFAULT DIRECTORY` clause, you must specify only one proper default directory. Otherwise a `Missing DEFAULT keyword` error will occur. 

  * You must enclose a filename in the `LOCATION` clause within quotes. Otherwise a `Missing keyword` error will occur. Note that the access driver will decide whether or not to allow a `LOCATION` clause in the query. If the clause is disallowed for a particular access driver, an error will be raised. 

  * For `ORACLE_LOADER` and `ORACLE_DATAPUMP` access drivers, the external file location in the `LOCATION` clause must be specified in the following format: directory: location, i.e, the directory and location must be separated by a colon. Multiple locations in the clause must be separated by a comma. Otherwise, a `Missing keyword` error will occur. 

  * Note that `LOCATION` will be made optional in `CREATE TABLE`, and must be specified either when creating or querying the external table. Otherwise an error will be raised in the access driver. 

  * When populating external data using `ORACLE DATAPUMP` via `CTAS`, the external file location must be specified. This will be the only case where `LOCATION` clause is mandatory in `CREATE TABLE`. 

  * When overriding access parameters, a proper access parameter list must be provided in the `ACCESS PARAMETERS` clause, with enclosing parentheses. 

Note that the syntax and allowable values for the access parameters in the
`modified_external_table` clause are the same as for the external table DDL
for each access driver. For more see [Oracle Database
Utilities](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-
database/23/sqlrf&id=SUTIL) for additional details regarding syntax and
permissible values.

  * If you specify the `REJECT LIMIT`, then it must either be `UNLIMITED` or some valid value that is within range. Otherwise a `Reject limit out of range` error will be raised. 

modify_external_table_properties

You can specify the external table properties that you want to modify at run
time using this clause. The parameters that you can modify are `DEFAULT
DIRECTORY`, `LOCATION`, `ACCESS PARAMETERS (BADFILE, LOGFILE, DISCARDFILE)`
and `REJECT LIMIT`.

Example: Overriding External Table Parameters in a Query

    
    
      SELECT * FROM
      sales_external EXTERNAL MODIFY (LOCATION 'sales_9.csvâ REJECT LIMIT UNLIMITED);

flashback_query_clause

Use the `flashback_query_clause` to retrieve data from a table, view, or
materialized view based on time dimensions associated with the data.

This clause implements SQL-driven Flashback, which lets you specify the
following:

  * A different system change number or timestamp for each object in the select list, using the clauses `VERSIONS` `BETWEEN` `{` `SCN` `|` `TIMESTAMP` `}` or `VERSIONS` `AS` `OF` `{` `SCN` `|` `TIMESTAMP` `}`. You can also implement session-level Flashback using the `DBMS_FLASHBACK` package. 

  * A valid time period for each object in the select list, using the clauses `VERSIONS` `PERIOD` `FOR` or `AS` `OF` `PERIOD` `FOR`. You can also implement valid-time session-level Flashback using the `DBMS_FLASHBACK_ARCHIVE` package. 

A Flashback Query lets you retrieve a history of changes made to a row. You
can retrieve the corresponding identifier of the transaction that made the
change using the `VERSIONS_XID` pseudocolumn. You can also retrieve
information about the transaction that resulted in a particular row version by
issuing an Oracle Flashback Transaction Query. You do this by querying the
`FLASHBACK_TRANSACTION_QUERY` data dictionary view for a particular
transaction ID.

VERSIONS BETWEEN { SCN | TIMESTAMP }

Specify `VERSIONS` `BETWEEN` to retrieve multiple versions of the rows
returned by the query. Oracle Database returns all committed versions of the
rows that existed between two SCNs or between two timestamp values. The first
specified SCN or timestamp must be earlier than the second specified SCN or
timestamp. The rows returned include deleted and subsequently reinserted
versions of the rows.

  * Specify `VERSIONS` `BETWEEN` `SCN` ... to retrieve the versions of the row that existed between two SCNs. Both expressions must evaluate to a number and cannot evaluate to NULL. `MINVALUE` and `MAXVALUE` resolve to the SCN of the oldest and most recent data available, respectively. 

  * Specify `VERSIONS` `BETWEEN` `TIMESTAMP` ... to retrieve the versions of the row that existed between two timestamps. Both expressions must evaluate to a timestamp value and cannot evaluate to NULL. `MINVALUE` and `MAXVALUE` resolve to the timestamp of the oldest and most recent data available, respectively. 

AS OF { SCN | TIMESTAMP }

Specify `AS` `OF` to retrieve the single version of the rows returned by the
query at a particular change number (SCN) or timestamp. If you specify `SCN`,
then `expr` must evaluate to a number. If you specify `TIMESTAMP`, then `expr`
must evaluate to a timestamp value. In either case, `expr` cannot evaluate to
NULL. Oracle Database returns rows as they existed at the specified system
change number or time.

Oracle Database provides a group of version query pseudocolumns that let you
retrieve additional information about the various row versions. Refer to
"[Version Query Pseudocolumns](Version-Query-
Pseudocolumns.md#GUID-F4DB0235-43A9-4AA2-8E9C-F2D9699D4AAD)" for more
information.

When both clauses are used together, the `AS` `OF` clause determines the SCN
or moment in time from which the database issues the query. The `VERSIONS`
clause determines the versions of the rows as seen from the `AS` `OF` point.
The database returns null for a row version if the transaction started before
the first `BETWEEN` value or ended after the `AS` `OF` point.

VERSIONS PERIOD FOR

Specify `VERSIONS` `PERIOD` `FOR` to retrieve rows from `table` based on
whether they are considered valid during the specified time period. In order
to use this clause, `table` must support Temporal Validity.

  * For `valid_time_column`, specify the name of the valid time dimension column for `table`. 

  * Use the `BETWEEN` clause to specify the time period during which rows are considered valid. Both expressions must evaluate to a timestamp value and cannot evaluate to NULL. `MINVALUE` resolves to the earliest date or timestamp in the start time column of `table`. `MAXVALUE` resolves to latest date or timestamp in the end time column of `table`. 

AS OF PERIOD FOR

Specify `AS` `OF` `PERIOD` `FOR` to retrieve rows from `table` based on
whether they are considered valid as of the specified time. In order to use
this clause, `table` must support Temporal Validity.

  * For `valid_time_column`, specify the name of the valid time dimension column for `table`. 

  * Use `expr` to specify the time as of which rows are considered valid. The expression must evaluate to a timestamp value and cannot evaluate to NULL. 

See Also:

  * [Oracle Database Development Guide](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/sqlrf&id=ADFNS967) for more information on Temporal Validity

Note on Flashback Queries

When performing a flashback query, Oracle Database might not use query
optimizations that it would use for other types of queries, which could have a
negative impact on performance. In particular, this occurs when you specify
multiple flashback queries in a hierarchical query.

Restrictions on Flashback Queries

These queries are subject to the following restrictions:

  * You cannot specify a column expression or a subquery in the expression of the `AS` `OF` clause. 

  * You cannot specify the `AS` `OF` clause if you have specified the `for_update_clause`. 

  * You cannot use the `AS` `OF` clause in the defining query of a materialized view. 

  * You cannot use the `VERSIONS` clause in flashback queries to temporary or external tables, or tables that are part of a cluster. 

  * You cannot use the `VERSIONS` clause in flashback queries to views. However, you can use the `VERSIONS` syntax in the defining query of a view. 

  * You cannot specify the `flashback_query_clause` if you have specified `query_name` in the `query_table_expression`.

partition_extension_clause

For `PARTITION` or `SUBPARTITION`, specify the name or key value of the
partition or subpartition within `table` from which you want to retrieve data.

For range- and list-partitioned data, as an alternative to this clause, you
can specify a condition in the `WHERE` clause that restricts the retrieval to
one or more partitions of `table`. Oracle Database will interpret the
condition and fetch data from only those partitions. It is not possible to
formulate such a `WHERE` condition for hash-partitioned data.

See Also:

"[References to Partitioned Tables and Indexes](Syntax-for-Schema-Objects-and-
Parts-in-SQL-Statements.md#GUID-FED2E424-3F06-4B2B-88D2-DE043CA6E0E4)" and
"[Selecting from a Partition: Example](SELECT.md#GUID-
CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__I2105152)"

dblink

For `dblink`, specify the complete or partial name for a database link to a
remote database where the table, view, or materialized view is located. This
database need not be an Oracle Database.

See Also:

  * "[References to Objects in Remote Databases](Syntax-for-Schema-Objects-and-Parts-in-SQL-Statements.md#GUID-61D0B206-A5EA-473F-AD04-7067D6E3914C)" for more information on referring to database links

If you omit `dblink`, then the database assumes that the table, view, or
materialized view is on the local database.

Restrictions on Database Links

Database links are subject to the following restrictions:

  * You cannot query a user-defined type or an object `REF` on a remote table. 

  * You cannot query columns of type `ANYTYPE`, `ANYDATA`, or `ANYDATASET` from remote tables. 

table | view | materialized_view | analytic_view | hierarchy

Specify the name of a table, view, materialized view, analytic view, or
hierarchy from which data is selected.

analytic_view

A persistent analytic view defined with the `CREATE` `ANALYTIC` `VIEW`
statement or a transitory analytic view defined in a `WITH` clause.

hierarchy

A hierarchy defined with the `CREATE` `HIERARCHY` statement.

sample_clause

The `sample_clause` lets you instruct the database to select from a random
sample of data from the table, rather than from the entire table.

See Also:

"[Selecting a Sample: Examples](SELECT.md#GUID-
CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__I2105143)"

BLOCK

`BLOCK` instructs the database to attempt to perform random block sampling
instead of random row sampling.

Block sampling is possible only during full table scans or index fast full
scans. If a more efficient execution path exists, then Oracle Database does
not perform block sampling. If you want to guarantee block sampling for a
particular table or index, then use the `FULL` or `INDEX_FFS` hint.

Beginning with Oracle Database 12c Release 2 (12.2.), you can specify block
sampling for external tables. In earlier releases, specifying block sampling
for external tables had no effect; row sampling was performed.

sample_percent

For `sample_percent`, specify the percentage of the total row or block count
to be included in the sample. The value must be in the range .000001 to, but
not including, 100. This percentage indicates the probability of each row, or
each cluster of rows in the case of block sampling, being selected as part of
the sample. It does not mean that the database will retrieve exactly
`sample_percent` of the rows of `table`.

WARNING:

The use of statistically incorrect assumptions when using this feature can
lead to incorrect or undesirable results.

SEED seed_value

Specify this clause to instruct the database to attempt to return the same
sample from one execution to the next. The `seed_value` must be an integer
between 0 and 4294967295. If you omit this clause, then the resulting sample
will change from one execution to the next.

Restrictions on sample_clause

The following restrictions apply to the `SAMPLE` clause:

  * You cannot specify the `SAMPLE` clause in a subquery in a DML statement. 

  * You can specify the `SAMPLE` clause in a query on a base table, a container table of a materialized view, or a view that is key preserving. You cannot specify this clause on a view that is not key preserving. 

subquery_restriction_clause

The `subquery_restriction_clause` lets you restrict the subquery in one of the
following ways:

WITH READ ONLY

Specify `WITH READ ONLY` to indicate that the table or view cannot be updated.

WITH CHECK OPTION

Specify `WITH CHECK OPTION` to indicate that Oracle Database prohibits any
changes to the table or view that would produce rows that are not included in
the subquery. When used in the subquery of a DML statement, you can specify
this clause in a subquery in the `FROM` clause but not in subquery in the
`WHERE` clause.

CONSTRAINT constraint

Specify the name of the `CHECK OPTION` constraint. If you omit this
identifier, then Oracle automatically assigns the constraint a name of the
form `SYS_C``n`, where n is an integer that makes the constraint name unique
within the database.

See Also:

"[Using the WITH CHECK OPTION Clause: Example](SELECT.md#GUID-
CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__I2066598)"

table_collection_expression

The `table_collection_expression` lets you inform Oracle that the value of
`collection_expression` should be treated as a table for purposes of query and
DML operations. The `collection_expression` can be a subquery, a column, a
function, or a collection constructor. Regardless of its form, it must return
a collection valueâthat is, a value whose type is nested table or varray.
This process of extracting the elements of a collection is called collection
unnesting.

The optional plus (+) is relevant if you are joining the `TABLE` collection
expression with the parent table. The + creates an outer join of the two, so
that the query returns rows from the outer table even if the collection
expression is null.

Note:

In earlier releases of Oracle, when `collection_expression` was a subquery,
`table_collection_expression` was expressed as `THE` `subquery`. That usage is
now deprecated.

The `collection_expression` can reference columns of tables defined to its
left in the `FROM` clause. This is called left correlation. Left correlation
can occur only in `table_collection_expression`. Other subqueries cannot
contains references to columns defined outside the subquery.

The optional `(+)` lets you specify that `table_collection_expression` should
return a row with all fields set to null if the collection is null or empty.
The `(+)` is valid only if `collection_expression` uses left correlation. The
result is similar to that of an outer join.

When you use the `(+)` syntax in the `WHERE` clause of a subquery in an
`UPDATE` or `DELETE` operation, you must specify two tables in the `FROM`
clause of the subquery. Oracle Database ignores the outer join syntax unless
there is a join in the subquery itself.

t_alias

Specify a correlation name, which is an alias for the table, view,
materialized view, or subquery for evaluating the query. This alias is
required if the select list references any object type attributes or object
type methods. Correlation names are most often used in a correlated query.
Other references to the table, view, or materialized view throughout the query
must refer to this alias.

See Also:

"[Using Correlated Subqueries: Examples](SELECT.md#GUID-
CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__I2066912)"

pivot_clause

The `pivot_clause` lets you write cross-tabulation queries that rotate rows
into columns, aggregating data in the process of the rotation. The output of a
pivot operation typically includes more columns and fewer rows than the
starting data set. The `pivot_clause` performs the following steps:

  1. The `pivot_clause` computes the aggregation functions specified at the beginning of the clause. Aggregation functions must specify a `GROUP` `BY` clause to return multiple values, yet the `pivot_clause` does not contain an explicit `GROUP` `BY` clause. Instead, the `pivot_clause` performs an implicit `GROUP` `BY`. The implicit grouping is based on all the columns not referred to in the `pivot_clause`, along with the set of values specified in the `pivot_in_clause`.). If you specify more than one aggregation function, then you must provide aliases for at least all but one of the aggregation functions. 

  2. The grouping columns and aggregated values calculated in Step 1 are configured to produce the following cross-tabular output:

    1. All the implicit grouping columns not referred to in the `pivot_clause`, followed by 

    2. New columns corresponding to values in the `pivot_in_clause`. Each aggregated value is transposed to the appropriate new column in the cross-tabulation. If you specify the `XML` keyword, then the result is a single new column that expresses the data as an XML string. The database generates a name for each new column. If you do not provide an alias for an aggregation function, then the database uses each pivot column value as the name for each new column to which that aggregated value is transposed. If you provide an alias for an aggregation function, then the database generates a name for each new column to which that aggregated value is transposed by concatenating the pivot column name, the underscore character (_), and the aggregation function alias. If a generated column name exceeds the maximum length of a column name, then an ORA-00918 error is returned. To avoid this issue, specify a shorter alias for the pivot column heading, the aggregation function, or both. 

The subclauses of the `pivot_clause` have the following semantics:

XML

The optional `XML` keyword generates XML output for the query. The `XML`
keyword permits the `pivot_in_clause` to contain either a subquery or the
wildcard keyword `ANY`. Subqueries and `ANY` wildcards are useful when the
`pivot_in_clause` values are not known in advance. With XML output, the values
of the pivot column are evaluated at execution time. You cannot specify `XML`
when you specify explicit pivot values using expressions in the
`pivot_in_clause`.

When XML output is generated, the aggregate function is applied to each
distinct pivot value, and the database returns a column of `XMLType`
containing an XML string for all value and measure pairs.

expr

For `expr`, specify an expression that evaluates to a constant value of a
pivot column. You can optionally provide an alias for each pivot column value.
If there is no alias, the column heading becomes a quoted identifier.

subquery

A subquery is used only in conjunction with the `XML` keyword. When you
specify a subquery, all values found by the subquery are used for pivoting.
The output is not the same cross-tabular format returned by non-XML pivot
queries. Instead of multiple columns specified in the `pivot_in_clause`, the
subquery produces a single XML string column. The XML string for each row
holds aggregated data corresponding to the implicit `GROUP` `BY` value of that
row. The XML string for each output row includes all pivot values found by the
subquery, even if there are no corresponding rows in the input data.

The subquery must return a list of unique values at the execution time of the
pivot query. If the subquery does not return a unique value, then Oracle
Database raises a run-time error. Use the `DISTINCT` keyword in the subquery
if you are not sure the query will return unique values.

ANY

The `ANY` keyword is used only in conjunction with the `XML` keyword. The
`ANY` keyword acts as a wildcard and is similar in effect to `subquery`. The
output is not the same cross-tabular format returned by non-XML pivot queries.
Instead of multiple columns specified in the `pivot_in_clause`, the `ANY`
keyword produces a single XML string column. The XML string for each row holds
aggregated data corresponding to the implicit `GROUP` `BY` value of that row.
However, in contrast to the behavior when you specify `subquery`, the `ANY`
wildcard produces an XML string for each output row that includes only the
pivot values found in the input data corresponding to that row.

`UNPIVOT` and "[Using PIVOT and UNPIVOT: Examples](SELECT.md#GUID-
CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__CHDFIIDD)"

unpivot_clause

The `unpivot_clause` rotates columns into rows.

  * The `INCLUDE` | `EXCLUDE` `NULLS` clause gives you the option of including or excluding null-valued rows. `INCLUDE` `NULLS` causes the unpivot operation to include null-valued rows; `EXCLUDE` `NULLS` eliminates null-values rows from the return set. If you omit this clause, then the unpivot operation excludes nulls. 

  * For `column`, specify a name for each output column that will hold measure values, such as `sales_quantity`. 

  * In the `pivot_for_clause`, specify a name for each output column that will hold descriptor values, such as quarter or product. 

  * In the `unpivot_in_clause`, specify the input data columns whose names will become values in the output columns of the `pivot_for_clause`. These input data columns have names specifying a category value, such as Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4. The optional `AS` clause lets you map the input data column names to the specified `literal` values in the output columns. 

The unpivot operation turns a set of value columns into one column. Therefore,
the data types of all the value columns must be in the same data type group,
such as numeric or character.

  * If all the value columns are `CHAR`, then the unpivoted column is `CHAR`. If any value column is `VARCHAR2`, then the unpivoted column is `VARCHAR2`. 

  * If all the value columns are `NUMBER`, then the unpivoted column is `NUMBER`. If any value column is `BINARY_DOUBLE`, then the unpivoted column is `BINARY_DOUBLE`. If no value column is `BINARY_DOUBLE` but any value column is `BINARY_FLOAT`, then the unpivoted column is `BINARY_FLOAT`. 

containers_clause

The `CONTAINERS` clause is useful in a multitenant container database (CDB).
This clause lets you query data in the specified table or view across all
containers in a CDB.

  * To query data in a CDB, you must be a common user connected to the CDB root, and the table or view must exist in the root and all PDBs. The query returns all rows from the table or view in the CDB root and in all open PDBs.

  * To query data in an application container, you must be a common user connected to the application root, and the table or view must exist in the application root and all PDBs in the application container. The query returns all rows from the table or view in the application root and in all open PDBs in the application container.

The table or view must be in your own schema. It is not necessary to specify
`schema`, but if you do then you must specify your own schema.

The query returns all rows from the table or view in the root and in all open
PDBs, except PDBs that are open in `RESTRICTED` mode. If the queried table or
view does not already contain a `CON_ID` column, then the query adds a
`CON_ID` column to the query result, which identifies the container whose data
a given row represents.

shards_clause

Use the` shards_clause` to query Oracle supplied objects such as `V$`,
`DBA/USER/ALL` views, and dictionary tables across shards. You can execute a
query with the `shards_clause` only on the shard catalog database.

This feature enables easier centralized management by providing the ability to
execute queries across all shards from a central shard catalog.

values_clause

You can use the `values_clause` in the `FROM` and `with_clause` of `SELECT` as
a table value constructor (TVC).

Each table value constructor contains a set of row value expressions (RVE).
The elements in each row expression should be homogeneous in number and their
type must be compatible.

The `c_alias` or column alias is the name of the column corresponding to each
expression in an RVE.

TVCs in the `FROM` clause of select statements can be used as table
expressions.

Example: Using the Values Constructor in the FROM Clause of SELECT

    
    
    SELECT * 
                FROM ( VALUES (1,'SCOTT'), 
                              (2,'SMITH'), 
                              (3,'JOHN' ) 
                     ) t1 (employee_id, first_name);

The example above creates an in-line table `t1` with two columns `employee_id`
and `first_name` and three rows.

If you use the `values_clause` with the [with_clause::=](SELECT.md#GUID-
CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__BABFAFID), you must specify the column
alias. Each column alias must correspond to the column produced by the TVC. In
this case, the TVC replaces the subquery.

Example: Using the Values Constructor in the With_Clause of SELECT:

    
    
    WITH X(foo, bar, baz) AS (
             VALUES (0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8) ) SELECT * FROM X;

The table and column aliases (`t_alias` and `c_alias`) are required unless you
use `values_clause` with `with_clause` in `SELECT`.

Restrictions

  * If multiple RVEs are specified, then each RVE should have the same cardinality. This means that each RVE must have the same number of elements.

  * Each element of the RVE can be a valid SQL expression that includes a column name, scalar valued subquery, bind variable, or any other expression that evaluates to a single value.

  * The type of the expression or a constant at the corresponding positions of RVE in a TVC should be implicitly convertible to the most general type following normal SQL type conversion rules. The type of expression that will be inferred will be the most general type of expression at the same position in all RVEs that constitute the TVC.

  * If a scalar valued subquery is used to compute the value of an element in a RVE then the select list of scalar valued subquery can contain exactly one expression.

  * If RVE is used in an `UPDATE`, or `MERGE` statement, then the keyword `DEFAULT` can be specified in a RVE for each position to indicate to the SQL engine that the default column value should be used for this column. 

  * The execution plan will have a new section that appears only when the TVC has RVEs consisting of constant values.

  * If the types of the corresponding elements in a RVE in a TVC have different constraints, then the type of the column will be the union of all the constraints or the most relaxed constraint.

  * An error will be thrown if a TVC, that consists of more than one RVE, is used in a place where a scalar valued subquery is expected.

  * The parallel behavior will be similar to union all queries on `DUAL`. TVC will not impact parallel behavior. 

  * RVEs cannot be nested, that is, a RVE cannot contain another RVE.

  * The maximum number of columns produced by the `with_clause` will be the same as the maximum number of columns in a database table. 

  * NDV and other statistics that are computed by the optimizer will be similar to a union of all queries on `DUAL`. 

  * The TVC clause will not have any restriction on number of RVEs other than the restriction imposed by available memory.

  * The elimination of `UNION ALL` branches on a predicate will be similar to `UNION ALL` queries with `DUAL`. 

join_clause

Use the appropriate `join_clause` syntax to identify tables that are part of a
join from which to select data. The `inner_cross_join_clause` lets you specify
an inner or cross join. The `outer_join_clause` lets you specify an outer
join. The `cross_outer_apply_clause` lets you specify a variation of an ANSI
`CROSS` `JOIN` or an ANSI `LEFT` `OUTER` `JOIN` with left correlation support.

When you join more than two row sources, you can use parentheses to override
default precedence. For example, the following syntax:

    
    
    SELECT ... FROM a JOIN (b JOIN c) ...
    

results in a join of `b` and `c`, and then a join of that result set with `a`.

CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__I2107296)"

inner_cross_join_clause

Inner joins return only those rows that satisfy the join condition.

INNER

Specify `INNER` to explicitly specify an inner join.

JOIN

The `JOIN` keyword explicitly states that a join is being performed. You can
use this syntax to replace the comma-delimited table expressions used in
`WHERE` clause joins with `FROM` clause join syntax.

ON condition

Use the `ON` clause to specify a join condition. Doing so lets you specify
join conditions separate from any search or filter conditions in the `WHERE`
clause.

USING (column)

When you are specifying an equijoin of columns that have the same name in both
tables, the `USING` `column` clause indicates the columns to be used. You can
use this clause only if the join columns in both tables have the same name.
Within this clause, do not qualify the column name with a table name or table
alias.

CROSS

The `CROSS` keyword indicates that a cross join is being performed. A cross
join produces the cross-product of two relations and is essentially the same
as the comma-delimited Oracle Database notation.

NATURAL

The `NATURAL` keyword indicates that a natural join is being performed. Refer
to [NATURAL](SELECT.md#GUID-CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__BABHGCAE)
for the full semantics of this clause.

outer_join_clause

Outer joins return all rows that satisfy the join condition and also return
some or all of those rows from one table for which no rows from the other
satisfy the join condition. You can specify two types of outer joins: a
conventional outer join using the `table_reference` syntax on both sides of
the join, or a partitioned outer join using the `query_partition_clause` on
one side or the other. A partitioned outer join is similar to a conventional
outer join except that the join takes place between the outer table and each
partition of the inner table. This type of join lets you selectively make
sparse data more dense along the dimensions of interest. This process is
called data densification.

query_partition_clause

The `query_partition_clause` lets you define a partitioned outer join. Such a
join extends the conventional outer join syntax by applying the outer join to
partitions returned by the query. Oracle Database creates a partition of rows
for each expression you specify in the `PARTITION` `BY` clause. The rows in
each query partition have same value for the `PARTITION` `BY` expression.

The `query_partition_clause` can be on either side of the outer join. The
result of a partitioned outer join is a `UNION` of the outer joins of each of
the partitions in the partitioned result set and the table on the other side
of the join. This type of result is useful for filling gaps in sparse data,
which simplifies analytic calculations.

If you omit this clause, then the database treats the entire table
expressionâeverything specified in `table_reference`âas a single
partition, resulting in a conventional outer join.

To use the `query_partition_clause` in an analytic function, use the upper
branch of the syntax (without parentheses). To use this clause in a model
query (in the `model_column_clauses`) or a partitioned outer join (in the
`outer_join_clause`), use the lower branch of the syntax (with parentheses).

Restrictions on Partitioned Outer Joins

Partitioned outer joins are subject to the following restrictions:

  * You can specify the `query_partition_clause` on either the right or left side of the join, but not both. 

  * You cannot specify a `FULL` partitioned outer join. 

  * If you specify the `query_partition_clause` in an outer join with an `ON` clause, then you cannot specify a subquery in the `ON` condition. 

See Also:

"[Using Partitioned Outer Joins: Examples](SELECT.md#GUID-
CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__I2177515)"

NATURAL

The `NATURAL` keyword indicates that a natural join is being performed. A
natural join is based on all columns in the two tables that have the same
name. It selects rows from the two tables that have equal values in the
relevant columns. If two columns with the same name do not have compatible
data types, then an error is raised. When specifying columns that are involved
in the natural join, do not qualify the column name with a table name or table
alias.

On occasion, the table pairings in natural or cross joins may be ambiguous.
For example, consider the following join syntax:

    
    
       a NATURAL LEFT JOIN b LEFT JOIN c ON b.c1 = c.c1
    

This example can be interpreted in either of the following ways:

    
    
       a NATURAL LEFT JOIN (b LEFT JOIN c ON b.c1 = c.c1) 
       (a NATURAL LEFT JOIN b) LEFT JOIN c ON b.c1 = c.c1
    

To avoid this ambiguity, you can use parentheses to specify the pairings of
joined tables. In the absence of such parentheses, the database uses left
associativity, pairing the tables from left to right.

Restriction on Natural Joins

You cannot specify a LOB column, columns of `ANYTYPE`, `ANYDATA`, or
`ANYDATASET`, or a collection column as part of a natural join.

outer_join_type

The `outer_join_type` indicates the kind of outer join being performed:

  * Specify `RIGHT` to indicate a right outer join. 

  * Specify `LEFT` to indicate a left outer join. 

  * Specify `FULL` to indicate a full or two-sided outer join. In addition to the inner join, rows from both tables that have not been returned in the result of the inner join will be preserved and extended with nulls. 

  * You can specify the optional `OUTER` keyword following `RIGHT`, `LEFT`, or `FULL` to explicitly clarify that an outer join is being performed. 

ON condition

Use the `ON` clause to specify a join condition. Doing so lets you specify
join conditions separate from any search or filter conditions in the `WHERE`
clause.

Restriction on the ON condition Clause

You cannot specify this clause with a `NATURAL` outer join.

USING column

In an outer join with the `USING` clause, the query returns a single column
that coalesces the two matching columns in the join. The coalesce function is
as follows:

    
    
    COALESCE (a, b) = a if a NOT NULL, else b.
    

Therefore:

  * A left outer join returns all the common column values from the left table in the `FROM` clause. 

  * A right outer join returns all the common column values from the right table in the `FROM` clause. 

  * A full outer join returns all the common column values from both joined tables.

Restriction on the USING column Clause

The `USING` `column` clause is subject to the following restrictions:

  * Within this clause, do not qualify the column name with a table name or table alias.

  * You cannot specify a LOB column or a collection column in the `USING` `column` clause. 

  * You cannot specify this clause with a `NATURAL` outer join. 

See Also:

cross_outer_apply_clause

This clause allows you to perform a variation of an ANSI `CROSS` `JOIN` or an
ANSI `LEFT` `OUTER` `JOIN` with left correlation support. You can specify a
`table_reference` or `collection_expression` to the right of the `APPLY`
keyword. The `table_reference` can be a table, inline view, or `TABLE`
collection expression. The `collection_expression` can be a subquery, a
column, a function, or a collection constructor. Regardless of its form, it
must return a collection valueâthat is, a value whose type is nested table
or varray. The `table_reference` or `collection_expression` can reference
columns of tables defined in the `FROM` clause to the left of the `APPLY`
keyword. This is called left correlation.

  * Specify `CROSS` `APPLY` to perform a variation of an ANSI `CROSS` `JOIN`. Only rows from the table on the left side of the join that produce a result set from `table_reference` or `collection_expression` are returned. 

  * Specify `OUTER` `APPLY` to perform a variation of an ANSI `LEFT` `OUTER` `JOIN`. All rows from the table on the left side of the join are returned. Rows that do not produce a result set from `table_reference` or `collection_expression` have the NULL value in the corresponding column(s). 

Restriction on the cross_outer_apply_clause

The `table_reference` cannot be a lateral inline view.

CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__BABDADCJ)

inline_analytic_view

An inline analytic view is a transitory analytic view that is specified in the
`FROM` clause. To create an inline analytic view, use the `ANALYTIC` `VIEW`
keyword and specify a `sub_av_clause` that defines the analytic view.
Optionally, you may specify an `inline_av_alias`, which is an alias for the
inline analytic view. The rules for the `inline_av_alias` are the same as the
rules for an inline view alias.

See Also:

[Analytic Views: Examples](SELECT.md#GUID-
CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__P-1314421-F3347731)

where_clause

The `WHERE` condition lets you restrict the rows selected to those that
satisfy one or more conditions. For `condition`, specify any valid SQL
condition.

If you omit this clause, then the database returns all rows from the tables,
views, or materialized views in the `FROM` clause.

Note:

If this clause refers to a `DATE` column of a partitioned table or index, then
the database performs partition pruning only if:

  * You created the table or index partitions by fully specifying the year using the `TO_DATE` function with a 4-digit format mask, and

  * You specify the date in the `where_clause` of the query using the `TO_DATE` function and either a 2- or 4-digit format mask. 

With Oracle Database 21c you can write macros for scalar expressions and use
them inside the `where_clause` , where it would be legal to call a PLSQL
function.

You must define these macro functions in PL/SQL and call them from SQL for
them to function as macros.

hierarchical_query_clause

The `hierarchical_query_clause` lets you select rows in a hierarchical order.

`SELECT` statements that contain hierarchical queries can contain the `LEVEL`
pseudocolumn in the select list. `LEVEL` returns the value 1 for a root node,
2 for a child node of a root node, 3 for a grandchild, and so on. The number
of levels returned by a hierarchical query may be limited by available user
memory.

Oracle processes hierarchical queries as follows:

  * A join, if present, is evaluated first, whether the join is specified in the `FROM` clause or with `WHERE` clause predicates. 

  * The `CONNECT` `BY` condition is evaluated. 

  * Any remaining `WHERE` clause predicates are evaluated. 

If you specify this clause, then do not specify either `ORDER` `BY` or `GROUP`
`BY`, because they will destroy the hierarchical order of the `CONNECT` `BY`
results. If you want to order rows of siblings of the same parent, then use
the `ORDER` `SIBLINGS` `BY` clause.

See Also:

"[Hierarchical Queries](Hierarchical-
Queries.md#GUID-0118DF1D-B9A9-41EB-8556-C6E7D6A5A84E)" for a discussion of
hierarchical queries and "[Using the LEVEL Pseudocolumn:
Examples](SELECT.md#GUID-CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__I2130122)"

START WITH Clause

Specify a condition that identifies the row(s) to be used as the root(s) of a
hierarchical query. The `condition` can be any condition as described in
[Conditions](Conditions.md#GUID-C2E3ED44-16E7-4924-9125-E1693B1022A8).
Oracle Database uses as root(s) all rows that satisfy this condition. If you
omit this clause, then the database uses all rows in the table as root rows.

CONNECT BY Clause

Specify a condition that identifies the relationship between parent rows and
child rows of the hierarchy. The `condition` can be any condition as described
in [Conditions](Conditions.md#GUID-C2E3ED44-16E7-4924-9125-E1693B1022A8).
However, it must use the `PRIOR` operator to refer to the parent row.

  * "[Hierarchical Query: Examples](SELECT.md#GUID-CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__I2130004)"

group_by_clause

Specify the `GROUP` `BY` clause if you want the database to group the selected
rows based on the value of `expr`(s) for each row and return a single row of
summary information for each group. If this clause contains `CUBE` or `ROLLUP`
extensions, then the database produces superaggregate groupings in addition to
the regular groupings.

Expressions in the `GROUP` `BY` clause can contain any columns of the tables,
views, or materialized views in the `FROM` clause, regardless of whether the
columns appear in the select list.

The `GROUP` `BY` clause groups rows but does not guarantee the order of the
result set. To order the groupings, use the `ORDER` `BY` clause.

If a column name in the source tables and column alias in the `SELECT` list
are the same, `GROUP BY` will interpret the identifier as the column name, not
the alias.

ROLLUP

The `ROLLUP` operation in the `simple_grouping_clause` groups the selected
rows based on the values of the first n, n-1, n-2, ... 0 expressions in the
`GROUP` `BY` specification, and returns a single row of summary for each
group. You can use the `ROLLUP` operation to produce subtotal values by using
it with the `SUM` function. When used with `SUM`, `ROLLUP` generates subtotals
from the most detailed level to the grand total. Aggregate functions such as
`COUNT` can be used to produce other kinds of superaggregates.

For example, given three expressions (n=3) in the `ROLLUP` clause of the
`simple_grouping_clause`, the operation results in n+1 = 3+1 = 4 groupings.

Rows grouped on the values of the first `n` expressions are called regular
rows, and the others are called superaggregate rows.

See Also:

[Oracle Database Data Warehousing
Guide](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-
database/23/sqlrf&id=DWHSG021) for information on using `ROLLUP` with
materialized views

CUBE

The `CUBE` operation in the `simple_grouping_clause` groups the selected rows
based on the values of all possible combinations of expressions in the
specification. It returns a single row of summary information for each group.
You can use the `CUBE` operation to produce cross-tabulation values.

For example, given three expressions (n=3) in the `CUBE` clause of the
`simple_grouping_clause`, the operation results in 2n = 23 = 8 groupings. Rows
grouped on the values of `n` expressions are called regular rows, and the rest
are called superaggregate rows.

See Also:

  * [Oracle Database Data Warehousing Guide](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/sqlrf&id=DWHSG021) for information on using `CUBE` with materialized views 

  * "[Using the GROUP BY CUBE Clause: Example](SELECT.md#GUID-CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__I2066443)"

GROUPING SETS

`GROUPING` `SETS` are a further extension of the `GROUP` `BY` clause that let
you specify multiple groupings of data. Doing so facilitates efficient
aggregation by pruning the aggregates you do not need. You specify just the
desired groups, and the database does not need to perform the full set of
aggregations generated by `CUBE` or `ROLLUP`. Oracle Database computes all
groupings specified in the `GROUPING` `SETS` clause and combines the results
of individual groupings with a `UNION` `ALL` operation. The `UNION` `ALL`
means that the result set can include duplicate rows.

Within the `GROUP` `BY` clause, you can combine expressions in various ways:

  * To specify composite columns, group columns within parentheses so that the database treats them as a unit while computing `ROLLUP` or `CUBE` operations. 

  * To specify concatenated grouping sets, separate multiple grouping sets, `ROLLUP`, and `CUBE` operations with commas so that the database combines them into a single `GROUP` `BY` clause. The result is a cross-product of groupings from each grouping set. 

See Also:

"[Using the GROUPING SETS Clause: Example](SELECT.md#GUID-
CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__I2091446)"

HAVING Clause

Use the `HAVING` clause to restrict the groups of returned rows to those
groups for which the specified `condition` is `TRUE`. If you omit this clause,
then the database returns summary rows for all groups.

Specify `GROUP` `BY` and `HAVING` after the `where_clause` and
`hierarchical_query_clause`. If you specify both `GROUP` `BY` and `HAVING`,
then they can appear in either order.

With Oracle Database 21c you can write macros for scalar expressions and use
them inside the `HAVING` clause, where it would be legal to call a PL/SQL
function.

You must define these macro functions in PL/SQL and call them from SQL for
them to function as macros.

  * "[Using the HAVING Condition: Example](SELECT.md#GUID-CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__I2130020)"

Restrictions on the GROUP BY Clause

This clause is subject to the following restrictions:

  * You cannot specify LOB columns, nested tables, or varrays as part of `expr`. 

  * The expressions can be of any form except scalar subquery expressions.

  * If the `group_by_clause` references any object type columns, then the query will not be parallelized. 

  * To group by position, the parameter `group_by_position_enabled` must be set to true, this is false by default 

model_clause

The `model_clause` lets you view selected rows as a multidimensional array and
randomly access cells within that array. Using the `model_clause`, you can
specify a series of cell assignments, referred to as rules, that invoke
calculations on individual cells and ranges of cells. These rules operate on
the results of a query and do not update any database tables.

When using the `model_clause` in a query, the `SELECT` and `ORDER` `BY`
clauses must refer only to those columns defined in the
`model_column_clauses`.

See Also:

  * The syntax description of `expr` in "[About SQL Expressions](About-SQL-Expressions.md#GUID-68789A5C-B142-496F-ADEE-837F75F95B2B)" and the syntax description of `condition` in [Conditions](Conditions.md#GUID-C2E3ED44-16E7-4924-9125-E1693B1022A8)

  * "[The MODEL clause: Examples](SELECT.md#GUID-CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__I2171160)"

main_model

The `main_model` clause defines how the selected rows will be viewed in a
multidimensional array and what rules will operate on which cells in that
array.

model_column_clauses

The `model_column_clauses` define and classify the columns of a query into
three groups: partition columns, dimension columns, and measure columns. For
`expr`, you can specify a column, constant, host variable, single-row
function, aggregate function, or any expression involving them. If `expr` is a
column, then the column alias (`c_alias`) is optional. If `expr` is not a
column, then the column alias is required. If you specify a column alias, then
you must use the alias to refer to the column in the `model_rules_clause`,
`SELECT` list, and the query `ORDER` `BY` clauses.

PARTITION BY

The `PARTITION` `BY` clause specifies the columns that will be used to divide
the selected rows into partitions based on the values of the specified
columns.

DIMENSION BY

The `DIMENSION` `BY` clause specifies the columns that will identify a row
within a partition. The values of the dimension columns, along with those of
the partition columns, serve as array indexes to the measure columns within a
row.

MEASURES

The `MEASURES` clause identifies the columns on which the calculations can be
performed. Measure columns in individual rows are treated like cells that you
can reference, by specifying the values for the partition and dimension
columns, and update.

cell_reference_options

Use the `cell_reference_options` clause to specify how null and absent values
are treated in rules and how column uniqueness is constrained.

IGNORE NAV

When you specify `IGNORE` `NAV`, the database returns the following values for
the null and absent values of the data type specified:

  * Zero for numeric data types

  * 01-JAN-2000 for datetime data types

  * An empty string for character data types

  * Null for all other data types

KEEP NAV

When you specify `KEEP` `NAV`, the database returns null for both null and
absent cell values. `KEEP` `NAV` is the default.

UNIQUE SINGLE REFERENCE

When you specify `UNIQUE` `SINGLE` `REFERENCE`, the database checks only
single-cell references on the right-hand side of the rule for uniqueness, not
the entire query result set.

UNIQUE DIMENSION

When you specify `UNIQUE` `DIMENSION`, the database checks that the
`PARTITION` `BY` and `DIMENSION` `BY` columns form a unique key to the query.
`UNIQUE` `DIMENSION` is the default.

model_rules_clause

Use the `model_rules_clause` to specify the cells to be updated, the rules for
updating those cells, and optionally, how the rules are to be applied and
processed.

Each rule represents an assignment and consists of a left-hand side and right-
hand side. The left-hand side of the rule identifies the cells to be updated
by the right-hand side of the rule. The right-hand side of the rule evaluates
to the values to be assigned to the cells specified on the left-hand side of
the rule.

UPSERT ALL

`UPSERT` `ALL` allows `UPSERT` behavior for a rule with both positional and
symbolic references on the left-hand side of the rule. When evaluating an
`UPSERT` `ALL` rule, Oracle performs the following steps to create a list of
cell references to be upserted:

  1. Find the existing cells that satisfy all the symbolic predicates of the cell reference.

  2. Using just the dimensions that have symbolic references, find the distinct dimension value combinations of these cells.

  3. Perform a cross product of these value combinations with the dimension values specified by way of positional references.

Refer to [Oracle Database Data Warehousing
Guide](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-
database/23/sqlrf&id=DWHSG0222) for more information on the semantics of
`UPSERT` `ALL`.

UPSERT

When you specify `UPSERT`, the database applies the rules to those cells
referenced on the left-hand side of the rule that exist in the
multidimensional array, and inserts new rows for those that do not exist.
`UPSERT` behavior applies only when positional referencing is used on the
left-hand side and a single cell is referenced. `UPSERT` is the default. Refer
to [cell_assignment](SELECT.md#GUID-
CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__I2168603) for more information on
positional referencing and single-cell references.

`UPDATE` and `UPSERT` can be specified for individual rules as well. When
either `UPDATE` or `UPSERT` is specified for a specific rule, it takes
precedence over the option specified in the `RULES` clause.

Note:

If an `UPSERT` `ALL`, `UPSERT`, or `UPDATE` rule does not contain the
appropriate predicates, then the database may implicitly convert it to a
different type of rule:

  * If an `UPSERT` rule contains an existential predicate, then the rule is treated as an `UPDATE` rule. 

  * An `UPSERT` `ALL` rule must have at least one existential predicate and one qualified predicate on its left side. If it has no existential predicate, then it is treated as an `UPSERT` rule. If it has no qualified predicate, then it is treated as an `UPDATE` rule 

UPDATE

When you specify `UPDATE`, the database applies the rules to those cells
referenced on the left-hand side of the rule that exist in the
multidimensional array. If the cells do not exist, then the assignment is
ignored.

AUTOMATIC ORDER

When you specify `AUTOMATIC` `ORDER`, the database evaluates the rules based
on their dependency order. In this case, a cell can be assigned a value once
only.

SEQUENTIAL ORDER

When you specify `SEQUENTIAL` `ORDER`, the database evaluates the rules in the
order they appear. In this case, a cell can be assigned a value more than
once. `SEQUENTIAL` `ORDER` is the default.

ITERATE ... [UNTIL]

Use `ITERATE` ... [`UNTIL`] to specify the number of times to cycle through
the rules and, optionally, an early termination condition. The parentheses
around the `UNTIL` condition are optional.

When you specify `ITERATE` ... [`UNTIL`], rules are evaluated in the order in
which they appear. Oracle Database returns an error if both `AUTOMATIC`
`ORDER` and `ITERATE` ... `[UNTIL]` are specified in the `model_rules_clause`.

cell_assignment

The `cell_assignment` clause, which is the left-hand side of the rule,
specifies one or more cells to be updated. When a `cell_assignment` references
a single cell, it is called a single-cell reference. When more than one cell
is referenced, it is called a multiple-cell reference.

All dimension columns defined in the `model_clause` must be qualified in the
`cell_assignment` clause. A dimension can be qualified using either symbolic
or positional referencing.

A symbolic reference qualifies a single dimension column using a Boolean
condition like `dimension_column``=``constant`. A positional reference is one
where the dimension column is implied by its position in the `DIMENSION` `BY`
clause. The only difference between symbolic references and positional
references is in the treatment of nulls.

Using a single-cell symbolic reference such as `a[x=null,y=2000]`, no cells
qualify because `x=null` evaluates to `FALSE`. However, using a single-cell
positional reference such as `a[null,2000]`, a cell where `x` is null and `y`
is 2000 qualifies because null = null evaluates to `TRUE`. With single-cell
positional referencing, you can reference, update, and insert cells where
dimension columns are null.

You can specify a condition or an expression representing a dimension column
value using either symbolic or positional referencing. `condition` cannot
contain aggregate functions or the `CV` function, and `condition` must
reference a single dimension column. `expr` cannot contain a subquery. Refer
to "[Model Expressions](Model-
Expressions.md#GUID-83D3FD56-8346-4D3F-A49E-5FE41FE19257)" for information
on model expressions.

single_column_for_loop

The `single_column_for_loop` clause lets you specify a range of cells to be
updated within a single dimension column.

The `IN` clause lets you specify the values of the dimension column as either
a list of values or as a subquery. When using `subquery`, it cannot:

  * Be a correlated query

  * Return more than 10,000 rows 

  * Be a query defined in the `WITH` clause 

The `FROM` clause lets you specify a range of values for a dimension column
with discrete increments within the range. The `FROM` clause can only be used
for those columns with a data type for which addition and subtraction is
supported. The `INCREMENT` and `DECREMENT` values must be positive.

Optionally, you can specify the `LIKE` clause within the `FROM` clause. In the
`LIKE` clause, `pattern` is a character string containing a single pattern-
matching character `%`. This character is replaced during execution with the
current incremented or decremented value in the `FROM` clause.

If all dimensions other than those used by a `FOR` loop involve a single-cell
reference, then the expressions can insert new rows. The number of dimension
value combinations generated by `FOR` loops is counted as part of the 10,000
row limit of the `MODEL` clause.

multi_column_for_loop

The `multi_column_for_loop` clause lets you specify a range of cells to be
updated across multiple dimension columns. The `IN` clause lets you specify
the values of the dimension columns as either multiple lists of values or as a
subquery. When using `subquery`, it cannot:

  * Be a correlated query

  * Return more than 10,000 rows 

  * Be a query defined in the `WITH` clause 

If all dimensions other than those used by a `FOR` loop involve a single-cell
reference, then the expressions can insert new rows. The number of dimension
value combinations generated by `FOR` loops is counted as part of the 10,000
row limit of the `MODEL` clause.

See Also:

[Oracle Database Data Warehousing
Guide](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-
database/23/sqlrf&id=DWHSG0223) for more information about using `FOR` loops
in the `MODEL` clause

order_by_clause

Use the `ORDER` `BY` clause to specify the order in which cells on the left-
hand side of the rule are to be evaluated. The `expr` must resolve to a
dimension or measure column. If the `ORDER` `BY` clause is not specified, then
the order defaults to the order of the columns as specified in the `DIMENSION`
`BY` clause. See [order_by_clause](SELECT.md#GUID-
CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__I2171079) for more information.

Restrictions on the order_by_clause

Use of the `ORDER` `BY` clause in the model rule is subject to the following
restrictions:

  * You cannot specify `SIBLINGS`, `position`, or `c_alias` in the `order_by_clause` of the `model_clause`. 

  * You cannot specify this clause on the left-hand side of the model rule and also specify a `FOR` loop on the right-hand side of the rule. 

expr

Specify an expression representing the value or values of the cell or cells
specified on the right-hand side of the rule. `expr` cannot contain a
subquery. Refer to "[Model Expressions](Model-
Expressions.md#GUID-83D3FD56-8346-4D3F-A49E-5FE41FE19257)" for information
on model expressions.

return_rows_clause

The `return_rows_clause` lets you specify whether to return all rows selected
or only those rows updated by the model rules. `ALL` is the default.

reference_model

Use the `reference_model` clause when you need to access multiple arrays from
inside the `model_clause`. This clause defines a read-only multidimensional
array based on the results of a query.

The subclauses of the `reference_model` clause have the same semantics as for
the `main_model` clause. Refer to [model_column_clauses](SELECT.md#GUID-
CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__I2168561) and
[cell_reference_options](SELECT.md#GUID-
CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__I2168572).

Restrictions on the reference_model Clause

This clause is subject to the following restrictions:

  * `PARTITION` `BY` columns cannot be specified for reference models. 

  * The subquery of the reference model cannot refer to columns in an outer subquery.

Set Operators: (UNION, INTERSECT, MINUS, EXCEPT) ALL

The set operators combine the rows returned by two `SELECT` statements into a
single result. The number and data types of the columns selected by each
component query must be the same, but the column lengths can be different. The
names of the columns in the result set are the names of the expressions in the
select list preceding the set operator.

If you combine more than two queries with set operators, then the database
evaluates adjacent queries from left to right. The parentheses around the
subquery are optional. You can use them to specify a different order of
evaluation.

Refer to "[The Set Operators](The-UNION-ALL-INTERSECT-MINUS-
Operators.md#GUID-B64FE747-586E-4513-945F-80CB197125EE)" for information on
these operators, including restrictions on their use.

order_by_clause

Use the `ORDER` `BY` clause to order rows returned by the statement. Without
an `order_by_clause`, no guarantee exists that the same query executed more
than once will retrieve rows in the same order.

SIBLINGS

The `SIBLINGS` keyword is valid only if you also specify the
`hierarchical_query_clause` (`CONNECT` `BY`). `ORDER` `SIBLINGS` `BY`
preserves any ordering specified in the hierarchical query clause and then
applies the `order_by_clause` to the siblings of the hierarchy.

expr

`expr` orders rows based on their value for `expr`. The expression is based on
columns in the select list or columns in the tables, views, or materialized
views in the `FROM` clause.

position

Specify `position` to order rows based on their value for the expression in
this position of the select list. The `position` value must be an integer.

You can specify multiple expressions in the `order_by_clause`. Oracle Database
first sorts rows based on their values for the first expression. Rows with the
same value for the first expression are then sorted based on their values for
the second expression, and so on. The database sorts nulls following all
others in ascending order and preceding all others in descending order. Refer
to "[Sorting Query Results](Sorting-Query-
Results.md#GUID-E45EF993-20AC-4552-860C-4D74EADB5BF2)" for a discussion of
ordering query results.

ASC | DESC

Specify whether the ordering sequence is ascending or descending. `ASC` is the
default.

NULLS FIRST | NULLS LAST

Specify whether returned rows containing null values should appear first or
last in the ordering sequence.

`NULLS` `LAST` is the default for ascending order, and `NULLS` `FIRST` is the
default for descending order.

Restrictions on the ORDER BY Clause

The following restrictions apply to the `ORDER` `BY` clause:

  * If you have specified the `DISTINCT` operator in this statement, then this clause cannot refer to columns unless they appear in the select list. 

  * An `order_by_clause` can contain no more than 255 expressions. 

  * You cannot order by a LOB, `LONG`, or `LONG` `RAW` column, nested table, or varray. 

  * If you specify a [group_by_clause](SELECT.md#GUID-CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__I2182483) in the same statement, then this `order_by_clause` is restricted to the following expressions: 

    * Constants 

    * Aggregate functions 

    * Analytic functions

    * The functions `USER`, `UID`, and `SYSDATE`

    * Expressions identical to those in the `group_by_clause`

    * Expressions comprising the preceding expressions that evaluate to the same value for all rows in a group

window_clause

Oracle Database Release 21c supports the `window_clause` in the `query_block`
clause.

Rules

  * If you use a new `window_specification` to specify an `existing_window_name` then 

    * `existing_window_name` must refer to an earlier entry in the `window_name` list 

    * You cannot use `existing_window_name` with `windowing_clause`

    * You cannot define a new window with the `query_partition_clause`. If `existing_window_name` has `order_by_clause`, then the new window definition cannot have `order_by_clause`. 

  * Note that `OVER` `window_name` is not equivalent to `OVER` (`window_name` â¦). `OVER` (`window_name` â¦) implies copying and modifying the window specification, and will be rejected if the referenced window specification includes a `windowing_clause`. 

Example

The following query shows the usage of `window_clause` specified as part of
table expression and window functions specified using the window name as
defined in window clause.

    
    
    SELECT
          ename, mgr,
          FIRST_VALUE(sal) OVER w AS "first",
          LAST_VALUE(sal) OVER w AS "last",
          NTH_VALUE(sal, 2) OVER w AS "second",
          NTH_VALUE(sal, 4) OVER w AS "fourth"
       FROM emp
       WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY deptno ORDER BY sal ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING);

row_limiting_clause

The `row_limiting_clause` allows you to limit the rows returned by the query.
You can specify an offset, and the number of rows or percentage of rows to
return. You can use this clause to implement top-N reporting. For consistent
results, specify the `order_by_clause` to ensure a deterministic sort order.

OFFSET

Use this clause to specify the number of rows to skip before row limiting
begins. `offset` must be a number or an expression that evaluates to a numeric
value. If you specify a negative number, then `offset` is treated as 0. If you
specify NULL, or a number greater than or equal to the number of rows returned
by the query, then 0 rows are returned. If `offset` includes a fraction, then
the fractional portion is truncated. If you do not specify this clause, then
`offset` is 0 and row limiting begins with the first row.

Restrictions

This clause is subject to the following restrictions:

  * You cannot specify this clause with the `for_update_clause`. 

  * If you specify this clause, then the select list cannot contain the sequence pseudocolumns `CURRVAL` or `NEXTVAL`. 

  * Materialized views are not eligible for an incremental refresh if the defining query contains the `row_limiting_clause`. 

  * If the select list contains columns with identical names and you specify the `row_limiting_clause`, then an `ORA-00918` error occurs. This error occurs whether the identically named columns are in the same table or in different tables. You can work around this issue by specifying unique column aliases for the identically named columns. 

fetch_clause

Use this clause to specify the number of rows or percentage of rows to return.
If you do not specify this clause, then all rows are returned, beginning at
row `offset` \+ 1.

APPROX | APPROXIMATE

Specify `APPROX` or `APPROXIMATE` to perform approximate vector search.

Rules

  * If you specify `APPROX` or `APPROXIMATE`, you must specify `rowcount` and `ROW` or `ROWS`. 

`rowcount` must be a positive integer between 1 and `UB4MAXVAL`.

  * You cannot specify `percent` and `WITH TIES` with `APPROX` or `APPROXIMATE`. 

  * Speicfy `WITH` `TARGET` first if you want to specify `ACCURACY`, followed by the input parameter `accuracy` and `PERCENT`. 

`accuracy` must be a postive integer literal between 1 and 100.

In the case where vector index is used, the accuracy, if specified, overwrites
the index specification, otherwise it inherits the index specification. In the
case where no vector index is used, exact results are returned, and the
accuracy is meaningless.

  * `PARAMETERS` `efs` and `nprobes` must be a positive integer literal between 1 and `UB4MAXVAL`. 

Rules for an Approximate Vector Search when a Vector Index is available

  * The `APPROXIMATE` syntax is used in row limiting clause. 

  * The approximate row limiting clause must be associated with an `ORDER BY` clause. 

  * The first key of the `ORDER BY` must be a distance function (`VECTOR_DISTANCE` or variant), which must have one and only one vector column operand. 

  * There may be additional `ORDER BY` expressions after the distance function, but not before. 

FIRST | NEXT

These keywords can be used interchangeably and are provided for semantic
clarity.

row_limiting_partition_clause

You can specify one or more levels of partitions in `partition_count` to apply
row limiting within each partition or each combination of all levels of
partitions.

You may specify unlimited levels of partitions. For each partition level, the
following rules apply:

  * `partition_countX` used without `APPROX`, must be a number or an expression that evaluates to a numeric value. It can be given as a constant literal, a bind, a non-scalar subquery, or a correlated variable. Otherwise an error is raised. 

  * If a negative number is specified, then it is treated as 0.

  * If `partition_countX` is greater than the number of partitions available in this level, then certain rows from all available partitions in this level are returned. 

  * If `partition_countX` includes a fraction, then the fractional portion is truncated. 

  * If `partition_countX` in any level is NULL, then 0 rows are returned. 

  * `partition_by_exprX` must be constants, columns, nonanalytic functions, function expressions, or expressions involving any of these. 

Given that the query result may be sorted in certain order, partitioned row
limiting clause filters out records so that only records that meet the
following conditions are returned:

  * the record has `partition_by_expr1` being one of the top `partition_count1` values of `partition_by_expr1`

  * within the same `partition_by_expr1`, the record has `partition_by_expr2` being one of the top `partition_count2` values of `partition_by_expr2`

  * within the same `partition_by_expr1` and `partition_by_expr2`, the record has `partition_by_expr3` being one of the top `partition_count3` values of `partition_by_expr3`

  * the same logic applies to all levels of partitions

  * within the nested partition of `partition_by_expr1`, ..., `partition_by_exprN`, the record is the top `rowcount` rows, or top `percent` percent of rows. If `WITH TIES` is specified, additional rows with the same sort key as the last row fetched are returned. 

row_specification

ROW | ROWS

Specify one of `ROW` or `ROWS`. These keywords can be used interchangeably and
are provided for semantic clarity.

If any of these conditions are not met, an exact search will be performed even
though the `APPROXIMATE` syntax is used. In addition, even if all the
conditions are met, the optimizer may employ other cost-based decisions and
choose not to use the index and perform exact search .

Example: Vector Search Query

    
    
    SELECT docID FROM vec_table
    ORDER BY VECTOR_DISTANCE(data, :query_vec)
    FETCH APPROX FIRST 20 ROWS ONLY;

You can use this clause in vector and non-vector contexts. See examples
[Partitioned Row Limiting in Non-Vector Context: Example](SELECT.md#GUID-
CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__P_ODN_DVT_3BC) and [Partitioned Row
Limiting in a Multi-Vector Search: Example](SELECT.md#GUID-
CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__P_A1V_X5T_3BC) .

row_specification

rowcount | percent PERCENT

Use `rowcount` to specify the number of rows to return. `rowcount` must be a
number or an expression that evaluates to a numeric value. If you specify a
negative number, then `rowcount` is treated as 0. If `rowcount` is greater
than the number of rows available beginning at row `offset` \+ 1, then all
available rows are returned. If `rowcount` includes a fraction, then the
fractional portion is truncated. If `rowcount` is NULL, then 0 rows are
returned.

Use `percent` `PERCENT` to specify the percentage of the total number of
selected rows to return. `percent` must be a number or an expression that
evaluates to a numeric value. If you specify a negative number, then `percent`
is treated as 0. If `percent` is NULL, then 0 rows are returned.

If you do not specify `rowcount` or `percent` `PERCENT`, then 1 row is
returned.

ONLY | WITH TIES

Specify `ONLY` to return exactly the specified number of rows or percentage of
rows.

Specify `WITH` `TIES` to return additional rows with the same sort key as the
last row fetched. `WITH` `TIES` must be specified with `order_by_clause` . If
you do not specify the `order_by_clause`, then no additional rows will be
returned.

You cannot use `WITH` `TIES` for approximate vector search and partition row
limit. If you specify it, approximate search will not happen, or if there are
partitions, the statement will fail.

"[Row Limiting: Examples](SELECT.md#GUID-
CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__BABEAACC)"

for_update_clause

The `FOR` `UPDATE` clause lets you lock the selected rows so that other users
cannot lock or update the rows until you end your transaction. You can specify
this clause only in a top-level `SELECT` statement, not in subqueries.

Note:

Prior to updating a LOB value, you must lock the row containing the LOB. One
way to lock the row is with an embedded `SELECT` ... `FOR` `UPDATE` statement.
You can do this using one of the programmatic languages or `DBMS_LOB` package.
For more information on lock rows before writing to a LOB, see [Oracle
Database SecureFiles and Large Objects Developer's
Guide](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-
database/23/sqlrf&id=ADLOB1004).

Nested table rows are not locked as a result of locking the parent table rows.
If you want the nested table rows to be locked, then you must lock them
explicitly.

Restrictions on the FOR UPDATE Clause

This clause is subject to the following restrictions:

  * You cannot specify this clause with the following other constructs: the `DISTINCT` operator, `CURSOR` expression, set operators, `group_by_clause`, or aggregate functions. 

  * The tables locked by this clause must all be located on the same database and on the same database as any `LONG` columns and sequences referenced in the same statement. 

See Also:

"[Using the FOR UPDATE Clause: Examples](SELECT.md#GUID-
CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__I2130052)"

Using the FOR UPDATE Clause on Views

In general, this clause is not supported on views. However, in some cases, a
`SELECT` ... `FOR` `UPDATE` query on a view can succeed without any errors.
This occurs when the view has been merged to its containing query block
internally by the query optimizer, and `SELECT` ... `FOR` `UPDATE` succeeds on
the internally transformed query. The examples in this section illustrate when
using the `FOR` `UPDATE` clause on a view can succeed or fail.

  * Using the `FOR` `UPDATE` clause on merged views 

An error can occur when you use the `FOR` `UPDATE` clause on a merged view if
both of the following conditions apply:

    * The underlying column of the view is an expression

    * The `FOR` `UPDATE` clause applies to a column list 

The following statement succeeds because the underlying column of the view is
not an expression:

    
        SELECT employee_id FROM (SELECT * FROM employees)
       FOR UPDATE OF employee_id;
    

The following statement succeeds because, while the underlying column of the
view is an expression, the `FOR` `UPDATE` clause does not apply to a column
list:

    
        SELECT employee_id FROM (SELECT employee_id+1 AS employee_id FROM employees)
       FOR UPDATE;
    

The following statement fails because the underlying column of the view is an
expression and the `FOR` `UPDATE` clause applies to a column list:

    
        SELECT employee_id FROM (SELECT employee_id+1 AS employee_id FROM employees)
       FOR UPDATE OF employee_id;
                     *
    Error at line 2:
    ORA-01733: virtual column not allowed here
    

  * Using the `FOR` `UPDATE` clause on non-merged views 

Since the `FOR` `UPDATE` clause is not supported on views, anything that
prevents view merging, such as the `NO_MERGE` hint, parameters that disallow
view merging, or something in the query structure that prevents view merging,
will result in an `ORA-02014` error.

In the following example, the `GROUP` `BY` statement prevents view merging,
which causes an error:

    
        SELECT avgsal
       FROM (SELECT AVG(salary) AS avgsal FROM employees GROUP BY job_id)
       FOR UPDATE;
    FROM (SELECT AVG(salary) AS avgsal FROM employees GROUP BY job_id)
         *
    ERROR at line 2:
    ORA-02014: cannot select FOR UPDATE from view with DISTINCT, GROUP BY, etc.

Note:

Due to the complexity of the view merging mechanism, Oracle recommends against
using the `FOR` `UPDATE` clause on views.

OF ... column

Use the `OF` ... `column` clause to lock the select rows only for a particular
table or view in a join. The columns in the `OF` clause only indicate which
table or view rows are locked. The specific columns that you specify are not
significant. However, you must specify an actual column name, not a column
alias. If you omit this clause, then the database locks the selected rows from
all the tables in the query.

NOWAIT | WAIT

The `NOWAIT` and `WAIT` clauses let you tell the database how to proceed if
the `SELECT` statement attempts to lock a row that is locked by another user.

  * Specify `NOWAIT` to return control to you immediately if a lock exists. 

  * Specify `WAIT` to instruct the database to wait `integer` seconds for the row to become available and then return control to you. 

If you specify neither `WAIT` nor `NOWAIT`, then the database waits until the
row is available and then returns the results of the `SELECT` statement.

SKIP LOCKED

`SKIP` `LOCKED` is an alternative way to handle a contending transaction that
is locking some rows of interest. Specify `SKIP` `LOCKED` to instruct the
database to attempt to lock the rows specified by the `WHERE` clause and to
skip any rows that are found to be already locked by another transaction. This
feature is designed for use in multiconsumer queue environments. It enables
queue consumers to skip rows that are locked by other consumers and obtain
unlocked rows without waiting for the other consumers to finish. Refer to
[Oracle Database Advanced Queuing User's
Guide](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-
database/23/sqlrf&id=ADQUE2835) for more information.

Note on the WAIT and SKIP LOCKED Clauses

If you specify `WAIT` or `SKIP` `LOCKED` and the table is locked in exclusive
mode, then the database will not return the results of the `SELECT` statement
until the lock on the table is released. In the case of `WAIT`, the `SELECT`
`FOR` `UPDATE` clause is blocked regardless of the wait time specified.

row_pattern_clause

The `MATCH_RECOGNIZE` clause lets you perform pattern matching. Use this
clause to recognize patterns in a sequence of rows in `table`, which is called
the row pattern input table. The result of a query that uses the
`MATCH_RECOGNIZE` clause is called the row pattern output table.

The `MATCH_RECOGNIZE` enables you to do the following tasks:

  * Logically partition and order the data with the `PARTITION` `BY` and `ORDER` `BY` clauses. 

  * Define measures, which are expressions usable in other parts of the SQL query, in the `MEASURES` clause. 

  * Define patterns of rows to seek using the `PATTERN` clause. These patterns use regular expression syntax, a powerful and expressive feature, applied to the pattern variables you define. 

  * Specify the logical conditions required to map a row to a row pattern variable in the `DEFINE` clause. 

See Also:

  * [Oracle Database Data Warehousing Guide](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/sqlrf&id=DWHSG8956) for more information on pattern matching 

  * "[Row Pattern Matching: Example](SELECT.md#GUID-CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__BABJHHDD)"

row_pattern_partition_by

Specify `PARTITION` `BY` to divide the rows in the row pattern input table
into logical groups called row pattern partitions. Use `column` to specify one
or more partitioning columns. Each partition consists of the set of rows in
the row pattern input table that have the same value(s) on the partitioning
column(s).

If you specify this clause, then matches are found within partitions and do
not cross partition boundaries. If you do not specify this clause, then all
rows of the row input table constitute a single row pattern partition.

row_pattern_order_by

Specify `ORDER` `BY` to order rows within each row pattern partition. Use
`column` to specify one or more ordering columns. If you specify multiple
columns, then Oracle Database first sorts rows based on their values for the
first column. Rows with the same value for the first column are then sorted
based on their values for the second column, and so on. Oracle Database sorts
nulls following all others in ascending order.

If you do not specify this clause, then the result of the `row_pattern_clause`
is nondeterministic and you may get inconsistent results each time you run the
query.

row_pattern_measures

Use the `MEASURES` clause to define one or more row pattern measure columns.
These columns are included in the row pattern output table and contain values
that are useful for analyzing data.

When you define a row pattern measure column, using the
`row_pattern_measure_column` clause, you specify its pattern measure
expression. The values in the column are calculated by evaluating the pattern
measure expression whenever a match is found.

row_pattern_measure_column

Use this clause to define a row pattern measure column.

  * For `expr`, specify the pattern measure expression. A pattern measure expression is an expression as described in [Expressions](Expressions.md#GUID-E7A5363C-AEE9-4809-99C1-1A9C6E3AE017) that can contain only the following elements: 

    * Constants: Text literals and numeric literals

    * References to any column of the row pattern input table

    * The `CLASSIFIER` function, which returns the name of the primary row pattern variable to which the row is mapped. Refer to [row_pattern_classifier_func](SELECT.md#GUID-CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__BABBGAAB) for more information. 

    * The `MATCH_NUMBER` function, which returns the sequential number of a row pattern match within the row pattern partition. Refer to [row_pattern_match_num_func](SELECT.md#GUID-CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__BABBEEBD) for more information. 

    * Row pattern navigation functions: `PREV`, `NEXT`, `FIRST`, and `LAST`. Refer to [row_pattern_navigation_func](SELECT.md#GUID-CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__BABGCIIA) for more information. 

    * Row pattern aggregate functions: [AVG](AVG.md#GUID-B64BCBF1-DAA0-4D88-9821-2C4D3FDE5E4A), [COUNT](COUNT.md#GUID-AEF08B79-024D-4E3A-B362-9715FB011776), [MAX](MAX.md#GUID-E5372020-A6DA-44BF-93BE-DA8C3F74CD01), [MIN](MIN.md#GUID-F7F04E18-1AD8-4D15-9491-4622AD847A74), or [SUM](SUM.md#GUID-5610BE2C-CFE5-446F-A1F7-B924B5663220). Refer to [row_pattern_aggregate_func](SELECT.md#GUID-CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__BABIDJGB) for more information. 

  * For `c_alias`, specify the alias for the pattern measure expression. Oracle Database uses this alias in the column heading of the row pattern output table. The `AS` keyword is optional. The alias can be used in other parts of the query, such as the `SELECT` ... `ORDER` `BY` clause. 

row_pattern_rows_per_match

This clause lets you specify whether the row pattern output table includes
summary or detailed data about each match.

  * If you specify `ONE` `ROW` `PER` `MATCH`, then each match produces one summary row. This is the default. 

  * If you specify `ALL` `ROWS` `PER` `MATCH`, then each match that spans multiple rows will produce one output row for each row in the match. 

row_pattern_skip_to

This clause lets you specify the point to resume row pattern matching after a
non-empty match is found.

  * Specify `AFTER` `MATCH` `SKIP` `TO` `NEXT` `ROW` to resume pattern matching at the row after the first row of the current match. 

  * Specify `AFTER` `MATCH` `SKIP` `PAST` `LAST` `ROW` to resume pattern matching at the next row after the last row of the current match. This is the default. 

  * Specify `AFTER` `MATCH` `SKIP` `TO` `FIRST` `variable_name` to resume pattern matching at the first row that is mapped to pattern variable `variable_name`. The `variable_name` must be defined in the `DEFINE` clause. 

  * Specify `AFTER` `MATCH` `SKIP` `TO` `LAST` `variable_name` to resume pattern matching at the last row that is mapped to pattern variable `variable_name`. The `variable_name` must be defined in the `DEFINE` clause. 

  * `AFTER` `MATCH` `SKIP` `TO` `variable_name` has the same behavior as `AFTER` `MATCH` `SKIP` `TO` `LAST` `variable_name`. 

See Also:

[Oracle Database Data Warehousing
Guide](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-
database/23/sqlrf&id=DWHSG8993) for more information on the `AFTER` `MATCH`
`SKIP` clauses

PATTERN

Use the `PATTERN` clause to define which pattern variables must be matched,
the sequence in which they must be matched, and the quantity of rows that must
be matched for each pattern variable.

A row pattern match consists of a set of contiguous rows in a row pattern
partition. Each row of the match is mapped to a pattern variable. The mapping
of rows to pattern variables must conform to the regular expression specified
in the `row_pattern` clause, and all conditions in the `DEFINE` clause must be
true.

Note:

It is outside the scope of this document to explain regular expression
concepts and details. If you are not familiar with regular expressions, then
you are encouraged to familiarize yourself with the topic using other sources.

The precedence of the elements that you specify in the regular expression of
the `PATTERNS` clause, in decreasing order, is as follows:

  * Row pattern elements (specified in the `row_pattern_primary` clause) 

  * Row pattern quantifiers (specified in the `row_pattern_quantifier` clause) 

  * Concatenation (specified in the `row_pattern_term` clause) 

  * Alternation (specified in the `row_pattern` clause) 

See Also:

[Oracle Database Data Warehousing
Guide](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-
database/23/sqlrf&id=DWHSG8986) for more information on the `PATTERN` clause

row_pattern

Use this clause to specify the row pattern. A row pattern is a regular
expression that can take one of the following forms:

  * A single row pattern term

For example: `PATTERN(A)`

  * A row pattern, a vertical bar, and a row pattern term

For example: `PATTERN(A|B)`

  * A recursively built row pattern, a vertical bar, and a row pattern term

For example: `PATTERN(A|B|C)`

The vertical bar in this clause represents alternation. Alternation matches a
single regular expression from a list of several possible regular expressions.
Alternatives are preferred in the order they are specified. For example, if
you specify `PATTERN(A|B|C)`, then Oracle Database attempts to match `A`
first. If `A` is not matched, then it attempts to match `B`. If `B` is not
matched, then it attempts to match `C`.

row_pattern_term

This clause lets you specify a row pattern term. A row pattern term can take
one of the following forms:

  * A single row pattern factor

For example: `PATTERN(A)`

  * A row pattern term followed by a row pattern factor.

For example: `PATTERN(A B)`

  * A recursively built row pattern term followed by a row pattern factor

For example: `PATTERN(A B C)`

The syntax used in the second and third examples represents concatenation.
Concatenation is used to list two or more items in a pattern to be matched and
the order in which they are to be matched. For example, if you specify
`PATTERN(A B C)`, then Oracle Database first matches `A`, then uses the
resulting matched rows to match `B`, then uses the resulting matched rows to
match `C`. Only rows that match `A`, `B`, and `C`, are included in the row
pattern match.

row_pattern_factor

This clause lets you specify a row pattern factor. A row pattern factor
consists of a row pattern element, specified using the `row_pattern_primary`
clause, and an optional row pattern quantifier, specified using the
`row_pattern_quantifier` clause.

row_pattern_primary

Use this clause to specify the row pattern element. [Table
19-1](SELECT.md#GUID-CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__BABIDGEJ "First
column lists row pattern quantifiers; second column provides descriptions.")
lists the valid row pattern elements and their descriptions.

Table 19-1 Row Pattern Elements

Row Pattern Element | Description  
---|---  
`variable_name` |  Specify a primary pattern variable name that is defined in the `row_pattern_definition` clause. You cannot specify a union pattern variable that is defined in the `row_pattern_subset_item` clause.   
`$` |  `$` matches the position after the last row in the partition. This element is an anchor. Anchors work in terms of positions rather than rows.   
`^` |  `^` matches the position before the first row in the partition. This element is an anchor. Anchors work in terms of positions rather than rows   
`(` `[``row_pattern``]` `)` |  Use `row_pattern` to specify the row pattern to be matched. An empty pattern `()` matches an empty set of rows.   
`{-` `row_pattern` `-}` |  Exclusion syntax. Use `row_pattern` to specify parts of the pattern to be excluded from the output of `ALL` `ROWS` `PER` `MATCH`.   
`row_pattern_permute` |  Use `row_pattern_permute` to specify a pattern that is a permutation of row pattern elements. Refer to [row_pattern_permute](SELECT.md#GUID-CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__BABEEAJJ) for the full semantics of this clause.   
  
row_pattern_permute

Use the `PERMUTE` clause to express a pattern that is a permutation of the
specified row pattern elements. For example, `PATTERN` `(PERMUTE` `(A,` `B,`
`C))` is equivalent to an alternation of all permutations of the three row
pattern elements `A`, `B`, and `C`, similar to the following:

    
    
    PATTERN (A B C | A C B | B A C | B C A | C A B | C B A)
    

Note that the row pattern elements are expanded lexicographically and that
each element to permute must be separated by a comma from the other elements.

See Also:

[Oracle Database Data Warehousing
Guide](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-
database/23/sqlrf&id=DWHSG9022) for more information on permutations

row_pattern_quantifier

Use this clause to specify the row pattern quantifier, which is a postfix
operator that defines the number of iterations accepted for a match.

Row pattern quantifiers are referred to as greedy; they will attempt to match
as many instances of the regular expression on which they are applied as
possible. The exception is row pattern quantifiers that have a question mark
(`?`) as a suffix, which are referred to as reluctant. They will attempt to
match as few instances as possible of the regular expression on which they are
applied.

[Table 19-2](SELECT.md#GUID-CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__BABGAGEF
"First column lists row pattern quantifiers; second column provides
descriptions.") lists the valid row pattern quantifiers and the number of
iterations they accept for a match. In this table, `n` and `m` represent
unsigned integers.

Table 19-2 Row Pattern Quantifiers

Row Pattern Quantifier | Number of Iterations Accepted for a Match  
---|---  
`*` |  0 or more iterations (greedy)  
`*?` |  0 or more iterations (reluctant)  
`+` |  1 or more iterations (greedy)  
`+?` |  1 or more iterations (reluctant)  
`?` |  0 or 1 iterations (greedy)  
`??` |  0 or 1 iterations (reluctant)

quantifiers

row_pattern_subset_clause

The `SUBSET` clause lets you specify one or more union row pattern variables.
Use the `row_pattern_subset_item` clause to declare each union row pattern
variable.

You can specify union row pattern variables in the following clauses:

  * `MEASURES` clause: In the expression for a row pattern measure column. That is, in expression `expr` of the `row_pattern_measure_column` clause. 

  * `DEFINE` clause: In the condition that defines a primary pattern variable. That is, in `condition` of the `row_pattern_definition` clause 

row_pattern_subset_item

This clause lets you create a grouping of multiple pattern variables that can
be referred to with a variable name of its own. The variable name that refers
to this grouping is called a union row pattern variable.

  * For `variable_name` on the left side of the equal sign, specify the name of the union row pattern variable. 

  * On the right side of the equal sign, specify a comma-separated list of distinct primary row pattern variables within parentheses. This list cannot include any union row pattern variables.

Guide](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-
database/23/sqlrf&id=DWHSG8989) for more information on defining union row
pattern variables

DEFINE

Use the `DEFINE` clause to specify one or more row pattern definitions. A row
pattern definition specifies the conditions that a row must meet in order to
be mapped to a specific pattern variable.

The `DEFINE` clause only supports running semantics.

row_pattern_definition_list

This clause lets you specify one or more row pattern definitions.

row_pattern_definition

This clause lets you specify a row pattern definition, which contains the
conditions that a row must meet in order to be mapped to the specified pattern
variable.

  * For `variable_name`, specify the name of the pattern variable. 

  * For `condition`, specify a condition as described in [Conditions](Conditions.md#GUID-C2E3ED44-16E7-4924-9125-E1693B1022A8), with the following extension: `condition` can contain any of the functions described by [row_pattern_navigation_func::=](SELECT.md#GUID-CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__BABDHIEA) and [row_pattern_aggregate_func::=](SELECT.md#GUID-CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__BABBDCFA). 

row_pattern_rec_func

This clause comprises the following clauses, which let you specify row pattern
recognition functions:

  * `row_pattern_classifier_func`: Use this clause to specify the `CLASSIFIER` function, which returns a character string whose value is the name of the variable to which the row is mapped. 

  * `row_pattern_match_num_func`: Use this clause to specify the `MATCH_NUMBER` function, which returns a numeric value with scale 0 (zero) whose value is the sequential number of the match within the row pattern partition. 

  * `row_pattern_navigation_func`: Use this clause to specify functions that perform row pattern navigation operations. 

  * `row_pattern_aggregate_func`: Use this clause to specify an aggregate function in the expression for a row pattern measure column or in the condition that defines a primary pattern variable. 

You can specify row pattern recognition functions in the following clauses:

  * `MEASURES` clause: In the expression for a row pattern measure column. That is, in expression `expr` of the `row_pattern_measure_column` clause. 

  * `DEFINE` clause: In the condition that defines a primary pattern variable. That is, in `condition` of the `row_pattern_definition` clause 

A row pattern recognition function may behave differently depending whether
you specify it in the `MEASURES` or `DEFINE` clause. These details are
explained in the semantics for each clause.

row_pattern_classifier_func

The `CLASSIFIER` function returns a character string whose value is the name
of the variable to which the row is mapped.

  * In the `MEASURES` clause: 

    * If you specify `ONE` `ROW` `PER` `MATCH`, then the query uses the last row of the match when processing the `MEASURES` clause, so the `CLASSIFIER` function returns the name of the pattern variable to which the last row of the match is mapped. 

    * If you specify `ALL` `ROWS` `PER` `MATCH`, then for each row of the match found, the `CLASSIFIER` function returns the name of the pattern variable to which the row is mapped. 

For empty matchesâthat is, matches that contain no rows, the `CLASSIFER`
function returns NULL.

  * In the `DEFINE` clause, the `CLASSIFIER` function returns the name of the primary pattern variable to which the current row is mapped. 

row_pattern_match_num_func

The `MATCH_NUMBER` function returns a numeric value with scale 0 (zero) whose
value is the sequential number of the match within the row pattern partition.

Matches within a row pattern partition are numbered sequentially starting with
1 in the order in which they are found. If multiple rows satisfy a match, then
they are all assigned the same match number. Note that match numbering starts
over again at 1 in each row pattern partition, because there is no inherent
ordering between row pattern partitions.

  * In the `MEASURES` clause: You can use `MATCH_NUMBER` to obtain the sequential number of the match within the row pattern. 

  * In the `DEFINE` clause: You can use `MATCH_NUMBER` to define conditions that depend upon the match number. 

row_pattern_navigation_func

This clause lets you perform the following row pattern navigation operations:

  * Navigate among the group of rows mapped to a pattern variable using the `FIRST` and `LAST` functions of the `row_pattern_nav_logical` clause. 

  * Navigate among all rows in a row pattern partition using the `PREV` and `NEXT` functions of the `row_pattern_nav_physical` clause 

  * Nest the `FIRST` or `LAST` function within the `PREV` or `NEXT` function using the `row_pattern_nav_compound` clause. 

row_pattern_nav_logical

This clause lets you use the `FIRST` and `LAST` functions to navigate among
the group of rows mapped to a pattern variable using an optional logical
offset.

  * The `FIRST` function returns the value of expression `expr` when evaluated in the first row of the group of rows mapped to the pattern variable that is specified in `expr`. If no rows are mapped to the pattern variable, then the `FIRST` function returns NULL. 

  * The `LAST` function returns the value of expression `expr` when evaluated in the last row of the group of rows mapped to the pattern variable that is specified in `expr`. If no rows are mapped to the pattern variable, then the `LAST` function returns NULL. 

  * Use `expr` to specify the expression to be evaluated. It must contain at least one row pattern column reference. If it contains more than one row pattern column reference, then all must refer to the same pattern variable. 

  * Use the optional `offset` to specify the logical offset within the set of rows mapped to the pattern variable. When specified with the `FIRST` function, the offset is the number of rows from the first row, in ascending order. When specified with the `LAST` function, the offset is the number of rows from the last row in descending order. The default offset is 0. 

For `offset`, specify a non-negative integer. It must be a runtime constant
(literal, bind variable, or expressions involving them), but not a column or
subquery.

If you specify an `offset` that is greater than or equal to the number of rows
mapped to the pattern variable minus 1, then the function returns NULL.

You can specify running or final semantics for the `FIRST` and `LAST`
functions as follows:

  * The `MEASURES` clause supports running and final semantics. Specify `RUNNING` for running semantics. Specify `FINAL` for final semantics. The default is `RUNNING`. 

  * The `DEFINE` clause supports only running semantics. Therefore, running semantics will be used whether you specify or omit `RUNNING`. You cannot specify `FINAL`. 

See Also:

    * [Oracle Database Data Warehousing Guide](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/sqlrf&id=DWHSG9001) for more information on the `FIRST` and `LAST` functions 

    * [Oracle Database Data Warehousing Guide](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/sqlrf&id=DWHSG9193) for more information on running and final semantics 

row_pattern_nav_physical

This clause lets you use the `PREV` and `NEXT` functions to navigate all rows
in a row pattern partition using an optional physical offset.

  * The `PREV` function returns the value of expression `expr` when evaluated in the previous row in the partition. If there is no previous row in the partition, then the `PREV` function returns NULL. 

  * The `NEXT` function returns the value of expression `expr` when evaluated in the next row in the partition. If there is no next row in the partition, then the NEXT function returns NULL. 

  * Use `expr` to specify the expression to be evaluated. It must contain at least one row pattern column reference. If it contains more than one row pattern column reference, then all must refer to the same pattern variable. 

  * Use the optional `offset` to specify the physical offset within the partition. When specified with the `PREV` function, it is the number of rows before the current row. When specified with the `NEXT` function, it is the number of rows after the current row. The default is 1. If you specify an offset of 0, then the current row is evaluated. 

For `offset`, specify a non-negative integer. It must be a runtime constant
(literal, bind variable, or expressions involving them), but not a column or
subquery.

The `PREV` and `NEXT` functions always use running semantics. Therefore, you
cannot specify the `RUNNING` or `FINAL` keywords with this clause.

See Also:

  * [Oracle Database Data Warehousing Guide](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/sqlrf&id=DWHSG8999) for more information on the `PREV` and `NEXT` functions

row_pattern_nav_compound

This clause lets you nest the `row_pattern_nav_logical` clause within the
`row_pattern_nav_physical` clause. That is, it lets you nest the `FIRST` or
`LAST` function within the `PREV` or `NEXT` function. The
`row_pattern_nav_logical` clause is evaluated first and then the result is
supplied to the `row_pattern_nav_physical` clause.

Refer to [row_pattern_nav_logical](SELECT.md#GUID-
CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__BABHCBFE) and
[row_pattern_nav_physical](SELECT.md#GUID-
CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__BABFIFBC) for the full semantics of
these clauses.

database/23/sqlrf&id=DWHSG9015) for more information on nesting the `FIRST`
and `LAST` functions within the `PREV` and `NEXT` functions

row_pattern_aggregate_func

This clause lets you use an aggregate function in the expression for a row
pattern measure column or in the condition that defines a primary pattern
variable.

For `aggregate_function`, specify any one of the
[AVG](AVG.md#GUID-B64BCBF1-DAA0-4D88-9821-2C4D3FDE5E4A),
[COUNT](COUNT.md#GUID-AEF08B79-024D-4E3A-B362-9715FB011776),

[MIN](MIN.md#GUID-F7F04E18-1AD8-4D15-9491-4622AD847A74), or
[SUM](SUM.md#GUID-5610BE2C-CFE5-446F-A1F7-B924B5663220) functions. The
`DISTINCT` keyword is not supported.

You can specify running or final semantics for aggregate functions as follows:

  * The `MEASURES` clause supports running and final semantics. Specify `RUNNING` for running semantics. Specify `FINAL` for final semantics. The default is `RUNNING`. 

  * The `DEFINE` clause supports only running semantics. Therefore, running semantics will be used whether you specify or omit `RUNNING`. You cannot specify `FINAL`.

Examples

SQL Macros - Scalar Valued Macros: Examples

Print Hello <name>

A PL/SQL function `greet` is defined as a scalar SQL Macro that returns the
string 'Hello, <name>! ' when called from a SQL `SELECT` statement.

    
    
    create or replace function greet(name varchar2 default 'World')
                      return varchar2 SQL_MACRO(Scalar) is
    begin
      return q'{ 'Hello, ' || name || '!' }';
    end;
    /

You can call `greet` in two ways:

Option 1: Without passing an explicit argument . In this case the default
argument is used and 'Hello World' is returned.

    
    
    SELECT greet ('World') from dual;
    –---------------
    Hello, World! 

Option 2: Passing an explicit argument . In this case the argument passed is
used and 'Hello Bob' is returned.

    
    
    SELECT greet ('Bob') from dual;
    –---------------
    Hello, Bob! 

Split String Based on Delimiter

The PL/SQL function `split_part` splits a string on the specified delimiter
and returns the part at the specified position.

    
    
    create or replace function split_part(string    varchar2, 
                                          delimiter varchar2,
                                          position  pls_integer)
              return varchar2 SQL_MACRO(Scalar) is
    begin
      return q'{
        regexp_substr(replace(string, delimiter||delimiter, delimiter||' '||delimiter), 
                      '[^'||delimiter||']+', 1, position, 'imx')
      }';
    end;
    /
    SELECT split_part( sysdate, '-', 2) month from dual;   
        –-------------
        MONTH
        –----
        OCT
    

SQL Macros - Table Valued Macros: Examples

The macro function `budget` computes the amount of each department's budget
for a given job. It returns the number of employees in each department with
the specified job title.

    
    
    create or replace function budget(job varchar2) return varchar2 SQL_MACRO is
    begin
      return q'{
         select deptno, sum(sal) budget 
         from emp 
         where job = budget.job
         group by deptno
      }';
    end;
    / 
    
    
    
    SELECT * FROM budget ('MANAGER');
       DEPTNO     BUDGET
    –----------  –-------
         20       2975
         30       2850
         10       2450
    

Using a PL/SQL Function in the WITH Clause: Examples

The following example declares and defines a PL/SQL function `get_domain` in
the `WITH` clause. The `get_domain` function returns the domain name from a
URL string, assuming that the URL string has the "`www`" prefix immediately
preceding the domain name, and the domain name is separated by dots on the
left and right. The `SELECT` statement uses `get_domain` to find distinct
catalog domain names from the `orders` table in the `oe` schema.

    
    
    WITH
     FUNCTION get_domain(url VARCHAR2) RETURN VARCHAR2 IS
       pos BINARY_INTEGER;
       len BINARY_INTEGER;
     BEGIN
       pos := INSTR(url, 'www.');
       len := INSTR(SUBSTR(url, pos + 4), '.') - 1;
       RETURN SUBSTR(url, pos + 4, len);
     END;
    SELECT DISTINCT get_domain(catalog_url)
      FROM product_information;
    /

Subquery Factoring: Example

The following statement creates the query names `dept_costs` and `avg_cost`
for the initial query block containing a join, and then uses the query names
in the body of the main query.

    
    
    WITH 
       dept_costs AS (
          SELECT department_name, SUM(salary) dept_total
             FROM employees e, departments d
             WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id
          GROUP BY department_name),
       avg_cost AS (
          SELECT SUM(dept_total)/COUNT(*) avg
          FROM dept_costs)
    SELECT * FROM dept_costs
       WHERE dept_total >
          (SELECT avg FROM avg_cost)
          ORDER BY department_name;
    
    DEPARTMENT_NAME                DEPT_TOTAL
    ------------------------------ ----------
    Sales                              304500
    Shipping                           156400

Recursive Subquery Factoring: Examples

The following statement shows the employees who directly or indirectly report
to employee 101 and their reporting level.

    
    
    WITH
      reports_to_101 (eid, emp_last, mgr_id, reportLevel) AS

Analytic Views: Examples

The following statement uses the persistent analytic view sales_av. The query
selects the `member_name` hierarchical attribute of time_hier, which is the
alias of a hierarchy of the same name, and values from the sales and units
measures of the analytic view that are dimensioned by the time attribute
dimension used by the time_hier hierarchy.. The results of the selection are
filtered to those for the YEAR level of the hierarchy. The results are
returned in hierarchical order.

    
    
    SELECT time_hier.member_name as TIME,
     sales,
     units
    FROM
     sales_av HIERARCHIES(time_hier)
    WHERE time_hier.level_name = 'YEAR'
    ORDER BY time_hier.hier_order;
    

The results of the query are the following:

    
    
    TIME    SALES           UNITS
    ------  -------------  ---------
    CY2011  6755115980.73  24462444

Transitory Analytic View Examples

The following statement defines the transitory analytic view my_av in the
`WITH` clause. The transitory analytic view is based on the persistent
analytic view sales_av. The lag_sales calculated measure is a `LAG`
calculation that is used at query time.

    
    
    WITH
      my_av ANALYTIC VIEW AS (
        USING sales_av HIERARCHIES (time_hier)
        ADD MEASURES (
          lag_sales AS (LAG(sales) OVER (HIERARCHY time_hier OFFSET 1))
        )
      )
    SELECT time_hier.member_name time, sales, lag_sales
    FROM my_av HIERARCHIES (time_hier)
    WHERE time_hier.level_name = 'YEAR'
    ORDER BY time_hier.hier_order;

The results of the query are the following:

    
    
    TIME         SALES   LAG_SALES
    ------  ----------  ----------
    CY2011  6755115981      (null)

    CY2015  7941102885  7579746353

The following statement defines a transitory analytic view that uses a filter
clause.

    
    
    WITH
      my_av ANALYTIC VIEW AS (
        USING sales_av HIERARCHIES (time_hier)
        FILTER FACT (
          time_hier TO quarter_of_year IN (1, 2) 
            AND year_name IN ('CY2011', 'CY2012')
        )
      )
    SELECT time_hier.member_name time, sales
      FROM my_av HIERARCHIES (time_hier)
      WHERE time_hier.level_name IN ('YEAR', 'QUARTER')
      ORDER BY time_hier.hier_order;

The results of the query are the following:

    
    
    TIME           SALES
    --------  ----------

Inline Analytic View Example

The following statement defines an inline analytic view in the `FROM` clause.
The transitory analytic view is based on the persistent analytic view
sales_av. The lag_sales calculated measure is a `LAG` calculation that is used
at query time.

    
    
    SELECT time_hier.member_name time, sales, lag_sales
    FROM
      ANALYTIC VIEW (
        USING sales_av HIERARCHIES (time_hier)
        ADD MEASURES (
          lag_sales AS (LAG(sales) OVER (HIERARCHY time_hier OFFSET 1))
        )
      )
    WHERE time_hier.level_name = 'YEAR'
    ORDER BY time_hier.hier_order;

The results of the query are the following:

    
    
    TIME         SALES   LAG_SALES
    ------  ----------  ----------
    CY2011  6755115981      (null)

Simple Query Examples

The following statement selects rows from the `employees` table with the
department number of 30:

    
    
    SELECT * 
       FROM employees 
       WHERE department_id = 30
       ORDER BY last_name;
    

The following statement selects the name, job, salary and department number of
all employees except purchasing clerks from department number 30:

    
    
    SELECT last_name, job_id, salary, department_id 
       FROM employees 
       WHERE NOT (job_id = 'PU_CLERK' AND department_id = 30)
       ORDER BY last_name; 
    

The following statement selects from subqueries in the `FROM` clause and for
each department returns the total employees and salaries as a decimal value of
all the departments:

    
    
    SELECT a.department_id "Department",
       a.num_emp/b.total_count "%_Employees",
       a.sal_sum/b.total_sal "%_Salary"
    FROM
    (SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) num_emp, SUM(salary) sal_sum
       FROM employees
       GROUP BY department_id) a,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) total_count, SUM(salary) total_sal
       FROM employees) b
    ORDER BY a.department_id;

Selecting from a Partition: Example

You can select rows from a single partition of a partitioned table by
specifying the keyword `PARTITION` in the `FROM` clause. This SQL statement
assigns an alias for and retrieves rows from the `sales_q2_2000` partition of
the sample table `sh.sales`:

    
    
    SELECT * FROM sales PARTITION (sales_q2_2000) s
       WHERE s.amount_sold > 1500
       ORDER BY cust_id, time_id, channel_id;
    

The following example selects rows from the `oe.orders` table for orders
earlier than a specified date:

    
    
    SELECT * FROM orders
       WHERE order_date < TO_DATE('2006-06-15', 'YYYY-MM-DD');

Selecting a Sample: Examples

The following query estimates the number of orders in the `oe.orders` table:

    
    
    SELECT COUNT(*) * 10 FROM orders SAMPLE (10);
    
    COUNT(*)*10
    -----------
             70
    

Because the query returns an estimate, the actual return value may differ from
one query to the next.

    
    
    SELECT COUNT(*) * 10 FROM orders SAMPLE (10);
    
    COUNT(*)*10
    -----------
             80
    

The following query adds a seed value to the preceding query. Oracle Database
always returns the same estimate given the same seed value:

    
    
    SELECT COUNT(*) * 10 FROM orders SAMPLE(10) SEED (1);
    
    COUNT(*)*10
    -----------
            130
    
    SELECT COUNT(*) * 10 FROM orders SAMPLE(10) SEED(4);
    
    COUNT(*)*10
    -----------
            120
    
    SELECT COUNT(*) * 10 FROM orders SAMPLE(10) SEED (1);
    
    COUNT(*)*10
    -----------
            130

Using Flashback Queries: Example

The following statements show a current value from the sample table
`hr.employees` and then change the value. The intervals used in these examples
are very short for demonstration purposes. Time intervals in your own
environment are likely to be larger.

    
    
    SELECT salary FROM employees
       WHERE last_name = 'Chung';
       
        SALARY
    ----------
          3800
    
    UPDATE employees SET salary = 4000
       WHERE last_name = 'Chung';
    1 row updated.
    
    SELECT salary FROM employees
       WHERE last_name = 'Chung';
    
        SALARY
    ----------
          4000
    

To learn what the value was before the update, you can use the following
Flashback Query:

    
    
    SELECT salary FROM employees
       AS OF TIMESTAMP (SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1' MINUTE)
       WHERE last_name = 'Chung';
       
        SALARY
    ----------
          3800
    

To learn what the values were during a particular time period, you can use a
version Flashback Query:

    
    
    SELECT salary FROM employees
      VERSIONS BETWEEN TIMESTAMP
        SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '10' MINUTE AND
        SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1' MINUTE
      WHERE last_name = 'Chung';
    

To revert to the earlier value, use the Flashback Query as the subquery of
another `UPDATE` statement:

    
    
    UPDATE employees SET salary =      
       (SELECT salary FROM employees
       AS OF TIMESTAMP (SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '2' MINUTE)
       WHERE last_name = 'Chung')
       WHERE last_name = 'Chung';
    1 row updated.
    
    SELECT salary FROM employees
       WHERE last_name = 'Chung';
       
        SALARY
    ----------
          3800

Using the GROUP BY Clause: Examples

To return the minimum and maximum salaries for each department in the
`employees` table, issue the following statement:

    
    
    SELECT department_id, MIN(salary), MAX (salary)
         FROM employees
         GROUP BY department_id
       ORDER BY department_id;
    

To return the minimum and maximum salaries for the clerks in each department,
issue the following statement:

    
    
    SELECT department_id, MIN(salary), MAX (salary)
         FROM employees
         WHERE job_id = 'PU_CLERK'
         GROUP BY department_id
       ORDER BY department_id;

The following example counts how many employees were hired each year. The
`GROUP BY` clause uses the column alias `YEAR_HIRED`, so this groups using the
expression `TRUNC(hire_date, 'YYYY')`

    
    
    SELECT TRUNC(hire_date, 'YYYY') year_hired, COUNT(*)
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY year_hired
    ORDER BY year_hired;
    
    YEAR_HIRED COUNT(*)
    ----------- ----------
    01-JAN-2011 1
    01-JAN-2012 7
    ...
    01-JAN-2017 19
    01-JAN-2018 11

The following example counts how many employees were hired each day. The query
groups by `HIRE_DATE`, which is the name of a column in `EMPLOYEES` and a
`SELECT` list alias. The column name takes priority, so the query groups by
the column, not the alias.

    
    
    SELECT TRUNC(hire_date, 'YYYY') hire_date, COUNT(*)
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY hire_date
    ORDER BY hire_date;

Using the GROUP BY CUBE Clause: Example

To return the number of employees and their average yearly salary across all
possible combinations of department and job category, issue the following
query on the sample tables `hr.employees` and `hr.departments`:

    
    
    SELECT DECODE(GROUPING(department_name), 1, 'All Departments',
          department_name) AS department_name,
       DECODE(GROUPING(job_id), 1, 'All Jobs', job_id) AS job_id,
       COUNT(*) "Total Empl", AVG(salary) * 12 "Average Sal"
       FROM employees e, departments d
       WHERE d.department_id = e.department_id
       GROUP BY CUBE (department_name, job_id)
       ORDER BY department_name, job_id;

Using the GROUPING SETS Clause: Example

The following example finds the sum of sales aggregated for three precisely
specified groups:

  * `(channel_desc, calendar_month_desc, country_id)`

  * `(channel_desc, country_id)`

  * `(calendar_month_desc, country_id)`

Without the `GROUPING` `SETS` syntax, you would have to write less efficient
queries with more complicated SQL. For example, you could run three separate
queries and `UNION` them, or run a query with a `CUBE(channel_desc,
calendar_month_desc, country_id)` operation and filter out five of the eight
groups it would generate.

    
    
    SELECT channel_desc, calendar_month_desc, co.country_id,
          TO_CHAR(sum(amount_sold) , '9,999,999,999') SALES$
       FROM sales, customers, times, channels, countries co
       WHERE sales.time_id=times.time_id 
          AND sales.cust_id=customers.cust_id 
          AND sales.channel_id= channels.channel_id 
          AND customers.country_id = co.country_id
          AND channels.channel_desc IN ('Direct Sales', 'Internet') 
          AND times.calendar_month_desc IN ('2000-09', '2000-10')
          AND co.country_iso_code IN ('UK', 'US')
      GROUP BY GROUPING SETS( 
          (channel_desc, calendar_month_desc, co.country_id), 
          (channel_desc, co.country_id), 
          (calendar_month_desc, co.country_id) );

Hierarchical Query: Examples

The following query with a `CONNECT` `BY` clause defines a hierarchical
relationship in which the `employee_id` value of the parent row is equal to
the `manager_id` value of the child row:

    
    
    SELECT last_name, employee_id, manager_id FROM employees
       CONNECT BY employee_id = manager_id
       ORDER BY last_name;
    

In the following `CONNECT` `BY` clause, the `PRIOR` operator applies only to
the `employee_id` value. To evaluate this condition, the database evaluates
`employee_id` values for the parent row and `manager_id`, `salary`, and
`commission_pct` values for the child row:

    
    
    SELECT last_name, employee_id, manager_id FROM employees
       CONNECT BY PRIOR employee_id = manager_id
       AND salary > commission_pct
       ORDER BY last_name; 
    

To qualify as a child row, a row must have a `manager_id` value equal to the
`employee_id` value of the parent row and it must have a `salary` value
greater than its `commission_pct` value.

Using the HAVING Condition: Example

To return the minimum and maximum salaries for the employees in each
department whose lowest salary is less than $5,000, issue the next statement:

    
    
    SELECT department_id, MIN(salary), MAX (salary)
       FROM employees
       GROUP BY department_id
       HAVING MIN(salary) < 5000
       ORDER BY department_id;
    
    DEPARTMENT_ID MIN(SALARY) MAX(SALARY)
    ------------- ----------- -----------
               10        4400        4400
               30        2500       11000
               50        2100        8200
               60        4200        9000
    

The following example uses a correlated subquery in a `HAVING` clause that
eliminates from the result set any departments without managers and managers
without departments:

    
    
    SELECT department_id, manager_id 
       FROM employees 
       GROUP BY department_id, manager_id HAVING (department_id, manager_id) IN
       (SELECT department_id, manager_id FROM employees x 
          WHERE x.department_id = employees.department_id)
       ORDER BY department_id;

Using the ORDER BY Clause: Examples

To select all purchasing clerk records from `employees` and order the results
by salary in descending order, issue the following statement:

    
    
    SELECT * 
       FROM employees
       WHERE job_id = 'PU_CLERK' 
       ORDER BY salary DESC; 
    

To select information from `employees` ordered first by ascending department
number and then by descending salary, issue the following statement:

    
    
    SELECT last_name, department_id, salary
       FROM employees
       ORDER BY department_id ASC, salary DESC, last_name; 
    

To select the same information as the previous `SELECT` and use the positional
`ORDER` `BY` notation, issue the following statement, which orders by
ascending `department_id`, then descending `salary`, and finally
alphabetically by `last_name`:

    
    
    SELECT last_name, department_id, salary 
       FROM employees 
       ORDER BY 2 ASC, 3 DESC, 1; 

The MODEL clause: Examples

The view created below is based on the sample `sh` schema and is used by the
example that follows.

    
    
    CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW sales_view_ref AS
      SELECT country_name country,
             prod_name prod,
             calendar_year year,

             COUNT(amount_sold) cnt
        FROM sales,times,customers,countries,products
        WHERE sales.time_id = times.time_id
          AND sales.prod_id = products.prod_id
          AND sales.cust_id = customers.cust_id
          AND customers.country_id = countries.country_id
          AND ( customers.country_id = 52779
                OR customers.country_id = 52776 )
          AND ( prod_name = 'Standard Mouse'
                OR prod_name = 'Mouse Pad' )
        GROUP BY country_name,prod_name,calendar_year;

The next example creates a multidimensional array from `sales_view_ref` with
columns containing country, product, year, and sales. It also:

  * Assigns the sum of the sales of the Mouse Pad for years 1999 and 2000 to the sales of the Mouse Pad for year 2001, if a row containing sales of the Mouse Pad for year 2001 exists.

  * Assigns the value of sales of the Standard Mouse for year 2001 to sales of the Standard Mouse for year 2002, creating a new row if a row containing sales of the Standard Mouse for year 2002 does not exist.

The first rule uses `UPDATE` behavior because symbolic referencing is used on
the left-hand side of the rule. The rows represented by the left-hand side of
the rule exist, so the measure columns are updated. If the rows did not exist,
then no action would have been taken.

The second rule uses `UPSERT` behavior because positional referencing is used
on the left-hand side and a single cell is referenced. The rows do not exist,
so new rows are inserted and the related measure columns are updated. If the
rows did exist, then the measure columns would have been updated.

Because `WITH` `TIES` is specified, the following statement returns the 5
percent of employees with the lowest salaries, plus all additional employees
with the same salary as the last row fetched in the previous example:

    
    
    SELECT employee_id, last_name, salary
      FROM employees
      ORDER BY salary
      FETCH FIRST 5 PERCENT ROWS WITH TIES;
    
    EMPLOYEE_ID LAST_NAME                     SALARY

            191 Perkins                         2500

Using the FOR UPDATE Clause: Examples

The following statement locks rows in the `employees` table with purchasing
clerks located in Oxford, which has `location_id` 2500, and locks rows in the
`departments` table with departments in Oxford that have purchasing clerks:

    
    
    SELECT e.employee_id, e.salary, e.commission_pct
       FROM employees e, departments d
       WHERE job_id = 'SA_REP'
       AND e.department_id = d.department_id
       AND location_id = 2500
       ORDER BY e.employee_id
       FOR UPDATE;
    

The following statement locks only those rows in the `employees` table with
purchasing clerks located in Oxford. No rows are locked in the `departments`
table:

    
    
    SELECT e.employee_id, e.salary, e.commission_pct
       FROM employees e JOIN departments d
       USING (department_id)
       WHERE job_id = 'SA_REP'
       AND location_id = 2500
       ORDER BY e.employee_id
       FOR UPDATE OF e.salary;

Using the WITH CHECK OPTION Clause: Example

The following statement is legal even though the third value inserted violates
the condition of the subquery `where_clause`:

    
    
    INSERT INTO (SELECT department_id, department_name, location_id
       FROM departments WHERE location_id < 2000)
       VALUES (9999, 'Entertainment', 2500);
    

However, the following statement is illegal because it contains the `WITH`
`CHECK` `OPTION` clause:

    
    
    INSERT INTO (SELECT department_id, department_name, location_id
       FROM departments WHERE location_id < 2000 WITH CHECK OPTION)
       VALUES (9999, 'Entertainment', 2500);
         *
    ERROR at line 2:
    ORA-01402: view WITH CHECK OPTION where-clause violation

Using PIVOT and UNPIVOT: Examples

The `oe.orders` table contains information about when an order was placed
(`order_date`), how it was place (`order_mode`), and the total amount of the
order (`order_total`), as well as other information. The following example
shows how to use the `PIVOT` clause to pivot `order_mode` values into columns,
aggregating `order_total` data in the process, to get yearly totals by order
mode:

    
    
    CREATE TABLE pivot_table AS
    SELECT * FROM
    (SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) year, order_mode, order_total FROM orders)
    PIVOT
    (SUM(order_total) FOR order_mode IN ('direct' AS Store, 'online' AS Internet));
    
    SELECT * FROM pivot_table ORDER BY year;
    
          YEAR      STORE   INTERNET
    ---------- ---------- ----------
          2004     5546.6
          2006   371895.5   100056.6
          2007  1274078.8  1271019.5
          2008   252108.3   393349.4
    

The `UNPIVOT` clause lets you rotate specified columns so that the input
column headings are output as values of one or more descriptor columns, and
the input column values are output as values of one or more measures columns.
The first query that follows shows that nulls are excluded by default. The
second query shows that you can include nulls using the `INCLUDE` `NULLS`
clause.

    
    
    SELECT * FROM pivot_table
      UNPIVOT (yearly_total FOR order_mode IN (store AS 'direct',
               internet AS 'online'))
      ORDER BY year, order_mode;
    
          YEAR ORDER_ YEARLY_TOTAL
    ---------- ------ ------------

Using Join Queries: Examples

The following examples show various ways of joining tables in a query. In the
first example, an equijoin returns the name and job of each employee and the
number and name of the department in which the employee works:

    
    
    SELECT last_name, job_id, departments.department_id, department_name
       FROM employees, departments
       WHERE employees.department_id = departments.department_id
       ORDER BY last_name, job_id;
    
    LAST_NAME           JOB_ID     DEPARTMENT_ID DEPARTMENT_NAME
    ------------------- ---------- ------------- ----------------------
    Abel                 SA_REP               80 Sales
    Ande                 SA_REP               80 Sales
    Atkinson             ST_CLERK             50 Shipping
    Austin               IT_PROG              60 IT
    . . .
    

You must use a join to return this data because employee names and jobs are
stored in a different table than department names. Oracle Database combines
rows of the two tables according to this join condition:

    
    
    employees.department_id = departments.department_id 
    

The following equijoin returns the name, job, department number, and
department name of all sales managers:

    
    
    SELECT last_name, job_id, departments.department_id, department_name
       FROM employees, departments
       WHERE employees.department_id = departments.department_id
       AND job_id = 'SA_MAN'
       ORDER BY last_name;
    
    LAST_NAME           JOB_ID     DEPARTMENT_ID DEPARTMENT_NAME
    ------------------- ---------- ------------- -----------------------
    Cambrault           SA_MAN                80 Sales
    Errazuriz           SA_MAN                80 Sales
    Partners            SA_MAN                80 Sales
    Russell             SA_MAN                80 Sales
    Zlotkey             SA_MAN                80 Sales
    

This query is identical to the preceding example, except that it uses an
additional `where_clause` condition to return only rows with a `job` value of
'`SA_MAN`'.

Using Subqueries: Examples

To determine who works in the same department as employee '`Lorentz`', issue
the following statement:

    
    
    SELECT last_name, department_id FROM employees
       WHERE department_id =
         (SELECT department_id FROM employees
          WHERE last_name = 'Lorentz')
       ORDER BY last_name, department_id; 
    

To give all employees in the `employees` table a 10% raise if they have
changed jobsâif they appear in the `job_history` tableâissue the following
statement:

    
    
    UPDATE employees 
        SET salary = salary * 1.1
        WHERE employee_id IN (SELECT employee_id FROM job_history);
    

To create a second version of the `departments` table `new_departments`, with
only three of the columns of the original table, issue the following
statement:

    
    
    CREATE TABLE new_departments 
       (department_id, department_name, location_id)
       AS SELECT department_id, department_name, location_id 
       FROM departments; 

Using Self Joins: Example

The following query uses a self join to return the name of each employee along
with the name of the employee's manager. A `WHERE` clause is added to shorten
the output.

    
    
    SELECT e1.last_name||' works for '||e2.last_name 
       "Employees and Their Managers"
       FROM employees e1, employees e2 
       WHERE e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id
          AND e1.last_name LIKE 'R%'
       ORDER BY e1.last_name;
    
    Employees and Their Managers   
    -------------------------------
    Rajs works for Mourgos
    Raphaely works for King
    Rogers works for Kaufling
    Russell works for King
    

The join condition for this query uses the aliases `e1` and `e2` for the
sample table `employees`:

    
    
    e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id

Using Outer Joins: Examples

The following example shows how a partitioned outer join fills data gaps in
rows to facilitate analytic function specification and reliable report
formatting. The example first creates a small data table to be used in the
join:

    
    
    SELECT d.department_id, e.last_name
       FROM departments d LEFT OUTER JOIN employees e
       ON d.department_id = e.department_id
       ORDER BY d.department_id, e.last_name;
    

Users familiar with the traditional Oracle Database outer joins syntax will
recognize the same query in this form:

    
    
    SELECT d.department_id, e.last_name
       FROM departments d, employees e
       WHERE d.department_id = e.department_id(+)
       ORDER BY d.department_id, e.last_name;
    

Oracle strongly recommends that you use the more flexible `FROM` clause join
syntax shown in the former example.

The left outer join returns all departments, including those without any
employees. The same statement with a right outer join returns all employees,
including those not yet assigned to a department:

Note:

The employee Zeuss was added to the employees table for these examples, and is
not part of the sample data.

    
    
    SELECT d.department_id, e.last_name
       FROM departments d RIGHT OUTER JOIN employees e
       ON d.department_id = e.department_id
       ORDER BY d.department_id, e.last_name;
    
    DEPARTMENT_ID LAST_NAME
    ------------- -------------------------
    . . .
              110 Gietz
              110 Higgins
                  Grant
                  Zeuss
    

It is not clear from this result whether employees Grant and Zeuss have
`department_id` `NULL`, or whether their `department_id` is not in the
`departments` table. To determine this requires a full outer join:

    
    
    SELECT d.department_id as d_dept_id, e.department_id as e_dept_id,
          e.last_name
       FROM departments d FULL OUTER JOIN employees e
       ON d.department_id = e.department_id
       ORDER BY d.department_id, e.last_name;
    
     D_DEPT_ID  E_DEPT_ID LAST_NAME
    ---------- ---------- -------------------------
      . . .
           110        110 Gietz
           110        110 Higgins
      . . .
           260
           270
                      999 Zeuss
                          Grant
    

Because the column names in this example are the same in both tables in the
join, you can also use the common column feature by specifying the `USING`
clause of the join syntax. The output is the same as for the preceding example
except that the `USING` clause coalesces the two matching columns
`department_id` into a single column output:

    
    
    SELECT department_id AS d_e_dept_id, e.last_name
       FROM departments d FULL OUTER JOIN employees e
       USING (department_id)
       ORDER BY department_id, e.last_name;
    
    D_E_DEPT_ID LAST_NAME
    ----------- -------------------------
      . . .
            110 Higgins
            110 Gietz
      . . .
            260
            270
            999 Zeuss
                Grant

Using Partitioned Outer Joins: Examples

The following example shows how a partitioned outer join fills in gaps in rows
to facilitate analytic calculation specification and reliable report
formatting. The example first creates and populates a simple table to be used
in the join:

    
    
    CREATE TABLE inventory (time_id    DATE,
                            product    VARCHAR2(10),
                            quantity   NUMBER);
    
    INSERT INTO inventory VALUES (TO_DATE('01/04/01', 'DD/MM/YY'), 'bottle', 10);
    INSERT INTO inventory VALUES (TO_DATE('06/04/01', 'DD/MM/YY'), 'bottle', 10);
    INSERT INTO inventory VALUES (TO_DATE('01/04/01', 'DD/MM/YY'), 'can', 10);
    INSERT INTO inventory VALUES (TO_DATE('04/04/01', 'DD/MM/YY'), 'can', 10);
    
    SELECT times.time_id, product, quantity FROM inventory 
       PARTITION BY  (product) 
       RIGHT OUTER JOIN times ON (times.time_id = inventory.time_id) 
       WHERE times.time_id BETWEEN TO_DATE('01/04/01', 'DD/MM/YY') 
          AND TO_DATE('06/04/01', 'DD/MM/YY') 
       ORDER BY  2,1; 
    
    TIME_ID   PRODUCT      QUANTITY
    --------- ---------- ----------
    01-APR-01 bottle             10
    02-APR-01 bottle
    03-APR-01 bottle
    04-APR-01 bottle
    05-APR-01 bottle
    06-APR-01 bottle             10
    01-APR-01 can                10
    02-APR-01 can
    03-APR-01 can
    04-APR-01 can                10
    05-APR-01 can
    06-APR-01 can
    
    12 rows selected.
    

The data is now more dense along the time dimension for each partition of the
product dimension. However, each of the newly added rows within each partition
is null in the quantity column. It is more useful to see the nulls replaced by
the preceding non-`NULL` value in time order. You can achieve this by applying
the analytic function `LAST_VALUE` on top of the query result:

    
    
    SELECT time_id, product, LAST_VALUE(quantity IGNORE NULLS) 
       OVER (PARTITION BY product ORDER BY time_id) quantity 
       FROM ( SELECT times.time_id, product, quantity 
                 FROM inventory PARTITION BY  (product) 
                    RIGHT OUTER JOIN times ON (times.time_id = inventory.time_id) 
       WHERE times.time_id BETWEEN TO_DATE('01/04/01', 'DD/MM/YY') 
          AND TO_DATE('06/04/01', 'DD/MM/YY')) 
       ORDER BY  2,1; 
    
    TIME_ID   PRODUCT      QUANTITY
    --------- ---------- ----------
    01-APR-01 bottle             10
    02-APR-01 bottle             10
    03-APR-01 bottle             10
    04-APR-01 bottle             10
    05-APR-01 bottle             10
    06-APR-01 bottle             10
    01-APR-01 can                10
    02-APR-01 can                10
    03-APR-01 can                10
    04-APR-01 can                10
    05-APR-01 can                10
    06-APR-01 can                10

time series calculations and examples of usage

Using Antijoins: Example

The following example selects a list of employees who are not in a particular
set of departments:

    
    
    SELECT * FROM employees 
       WHERE department_id NOT IN 
       (SELECT department_id FROM departments 
           WHERE location_id = 1700)
       ORDER BY last_name;

Using Semijoins: Example

In the following example, only one row needs to be returned from the
`departments` table, even though many rows in the `employees` table might
match the subquery. If no index has been defined on the `salary` column in
`employees`, then a semijoin can be used to improve query performance.

    
    
    SELECT * FROM departments 
       WHERE EXISTS 
       (SELECT * FROM employees 
           WHERE departments.department_id = employees.department_id 
           AND employees.salary > 2500)
       ORDER BY department_name;

Using CROSS APPLY and OUTER APPLY Joins: Examples

The following statement uses the `CROSS` `APPLY` clause of the
`cross_outer_apply_clause`. The join returns only rows from the table on the
left side of the join (`departments`) that produce a result from the inline
view on the right side of the join. That is, the join returns only the
departments that have at least one employee. The `WHERE` clause restricts the
result set to include only the Marketing, Operations, and Public Relations
departments. However, the Operations department is not included in the result
set because it has no employees.

    
    
    SELECT d.department_name, v.employee_id, v.last_name
      FROM departments d CROSS APPLY (SELECT * FROM employees e
                                      WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id) v
      WHERE d.department_name IN ('Marketing', 'Operations', 'Public Relations')
      ORDER BY d.department_name, v.employee_id;
    
    DEPARTMENT_NAME                EMPLOYEE_ID LAST_NAME
    ------------------------------ ----------- -------------------------
    Marketing                      201         Hartstein
    Marketing                      202         Fay
    Public Relations               204         Baer
    

The following statement uses the `OUTER` `APPLY` clause of the
`cross_outer_apply_clause`. The join returns all rows from the table on the
left side of the join (`departments`) regardless of whether they produce a
result from the inline view on the right side of the join. That is, the join
returns all departments regardless of whether the departments have any
employees. The `WHERE` clause restricts the result set to include only the
Marketing, Operations, and Public Relations departments. The Operations
department is included in the result set even though it has no employees.

    
    
    SELECT d.department_name, v.employee_id, v.last_name
      FROM departments d OUTER APPLY (SELECT * FROM employees e
                                      WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id) v
      WHERE d.department_name IN ('Marketing', 'Operations', 'Public Relations')
      ORDER by d.department_name, v.employee_id;
    
    DEPARTMENT_NAME                EMPLOYEE_ID LAST_NAME
    ------------------------------ ----------- -------------------------
    Marketing                      201         Hartstein
    Marketing                      202         Fay
    Operations
    Public Relations               204         Baer

Using Lateral Inline Views: Example

The following example shows a join with two operands. The second operand is an
inline view that specifies the first operand, table `e`, in the `WHERE`
clause. This results in an error.

    
    
    SELECT * FROM employees e, (SELECT * FROM departments d
                                WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id);
    ORA-00904: "E"."DEPARTMENT_ID": invalid identifier
    

The following example shows a join with two operands. The second operand is a
lateral inline view that specifies the first operand, table `e`, in the
`WHERE` clause and succeeds without an error.

    
    
    SELECT * FROM employees e, LATERAL(SELECT * FROM departments d
                                       WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id);

Table Collections: Examples

You can perform DML operations on nested tables only if they are defined as
columns of a table. Therefore, when the `query_table_expr_clause` of an
`INSERT`, `DELETE`, or `UPDATE` statement is a `table_collection_expression`,
the collection expression must be a subquery that uses the `TABLE` collection
expression to select the nested table column of the table. The examples that
follow are based on the following scenario:

Suppose the database contains a table `hr_info` with columns `department_id`,
`location_id`, and `manager_id`, and a column of nested table type `people`
which has `last_name`, `department_id`, and `salary` columns for all the
employees of each respective manager:

    
    
    CREATE TYPE people_typ AS OBJECT (
       last_name      VARCHAR2(25),
       department_id  NUMBER(4),
       salary         NUMBER(8,2));
    /
    CREATE TYPE people_tab_typ AS TABLE OF people_typ;
    /
    CREATE TABLE hr_info (
       department_id   NUMBER(4),
       location_id     NUMBER(4),
       manager_id      NUMBER(6),
       people          people_tab_typ)
       NESTED TABLE people STORE AS people_stor_tab;
    
    INSERT INTO hr_info VALUES (280, 1800, 999, people_tab_typ());
    

The following example inserts into the `people` nested table column of the
`hr_info` table for department 280:

    
    
    INSERT INTO TABLE(SELECT h.people FROM hr_info h
       WHERE h.department_id = 280)
       VALUES ('Smith', 280, 1750);
    

The next example updates the department 280 `people` nested table:

    
    
    UPDATE TABLE(SELECT h.people FROM hr_info h
       WHERE h.department_id = 280) p
       SET p.salary = p.salary + 100;
    

The next example deletes from the department 280 `people` nested table:

    
    
    DELETE TABLE(SELECT h.people FROM hr_info h
       WHERE h.department_id = 280) p
       WHERE p.salary > 1700;

Collection Unnesting: Examples

To select data from a nested table column, use the `TABLE` collection
expression to treat the nested table as columns of a table. This process is
called collection unnesting.

You could get all the rows from `hr_info`, which was created in the preceding
example, and all the rows from the `people` nested table column of `hr_info`
using the following statement:

    
    
    SELECT t1.department_id, t2.* FROM hr_info t1, TABLE(t1.people) t2
       WHERE t2.department_id = t1.department_id;
    

Now suppose that `people` is not a nested table column of `hr_info`, but is
instead a separate table with columns `last_name`, `department_id`, `address`,
`hiredate`, and `salary`. You can extract the same rows as in the preceding
example with this statement:

    
    
    SELECT t1.department_id, t2.* 
       FROM hr_info t1, TABLE(CAST(MULTISET(
          SELECT t3.last_name, t3.department_id, t3.salary 
             FROM people t3
          WHERE t3.department_id = t1.department_id)
          AS people_tab_typ)) t2;
    

Finally, suppose that `people` is neither a nested table column of table
`hr_info` nor a table itself. Instead, you have created a function
`people_func` that extracts from various sources the name, department, and
salary of all employees. You can get the same information as in the preceding
examples with the following query:

    
    
    SELECT t1.department_id, t2.* FROM hr_info t1, TABLE(CAST
       (people_func( ... ) AS people_tab_typ)) t2;

Using the LEVEL Pseudocolumn: Examples

The following statement returns all employees in hierarchical order. The root
row is defined to be the employee whose job is `AD_VP`. The child rows of a
parent row are defined to be those who have the employee number of the parent
row as their manager number.

    
    
    SELECT LPAD(' ',2*(LEVEL-1)) || last_name org_chart, 
            employee_id, manager_id, job_id
        FROM employees
        START WITH job_id = 'AD_VP'

Oracle Database does not return the manager `Greenberg`, although it does
return employees who are managed by `Greenberg`.

The following statement is similar to the first one, except that it uses the
`LEVEL` pseudocolumn to select only the first two levels of the management
hierarchy:

    
    
    SELECT LPAD(' ',2*(LEVEL-1)) || last_name org_chart, 
    employee_id, manager_id, job_id 
        FROM employees
        START WITH job_id = 'AD_PRES'

Using Distributed Queries: Example

This example shows a query that joins the `departments` table on the local
database with the `employees` table on the `remote` database:

    
    
    SELECT last_name, department_name 
       FROM employees@remote, departments
       WHERE employees.department_id = departments.department_id; 

Using Correlated Subqueries: Examples

The following examples show the general syntax of a correlated subquery:

    
    
    SELECT select_list 
        FROM table1 t_alias1 
        WHERE expr operator 
            (SELECT column_list 
                FROM table2 t_alias2 
                WHERE t_alias1.column 
                   operator t_alias2.column); 
    
    UPDATE table1 t_alias1 
        SET column = 
            (SELECT expr 
                FROM table2 t_alias2 
                WHERE t_alias1.column = t_alias2.column); 
    
    DELETE FROM table1 t_alias1 
        WHERE column operator 
            (SELECT expr 
                FROM table2 t_alias2 
                WHERE t_alias1.column = t_alias2.column); 
    

The following statement returns data about employees whose salaries exceed
their department average. The following statement assigns an alias to
`employees`, the table containing the salary information, and then uses the
alias in a correlated subquery:

    
    
    SELECT department_id, last_name, salary 
       FROM employees x 
       WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) 
          FROM employees 
          WHERE x.department_id = department_id) 
       ORDER BY department_id; 
    

For each row of the `employees` table, the parent query uses the correlated
subquery to compute the average salary for members of the same department. The
correlated subquery performs the following steps for each row of the
`employees` table:

  1. The `department_id` of the row is determined. 

  2. The `department_id` is then used to evaluate the parent query. 

  3. If the salary in that row is greater than the average salary of the departments of that row, then the row is returned. 

The subquery is evaluated once for each row of the `employees` table.

Selecting from the DUAL Table: Example

The following statement returns the current date:

    
    
    SELECT CURRENT_DATE FROM DUAL; 
    

You could select `CURRENT_DATE` from the `employees` table, but the database
would return 14 rows of the same `CURRENT_DATE`, one for every row of the
`employees` table. Selecting from `DUAL` is more convenient.

From Release 23 you can omit the optional `FROM` clause as in the following
example:

    
    
    SELECT CURRENT_DATE;

Selecting Sequence Values: Examples

The following statement increments the `employees_seq` sequence and returns
the new value:

    
    
    SELECT employees_seq.nextval 
        FROM DUAL; 
    

The following statement selects the current value of `employees_seq`:

    
    
    SELECT employees_seq.currval 
        FROM DUAL; 

Row Pattern Matching: Example

This example uses row pattern matching to query stock price data. The
following statements create table `Ticker` and inserts stock price data into
the table:

    
    
    CREATE TABLE Ticker (SYMBOL VARCHAR2(10), tstamp DATE, price NUMBER);
    
    INSERT INTO Ticker VALUES('ACME', '01-Apr-11', 12);
    INSERT INTO Ticker VALUES('ACME', '02-Apr-11', 17);
    INSERT INTO Ticker VALUES('ACME', '03-Apr-11', 19);
    INSERT INTO Ticker VALUES('ACME', '04-Apr-11', 21);
    INSERT INTO Ticker VALUES('ACME', '05-Apr-11', 25);
    INSERT INTO Ticker VALUES('ACME', '06-Apr-11', 12);
    INSERT INTO Ticker VALUES('ACME', '07-Apr-11', 15);
    INSERT INTO Ticker VALUES('ACME', '08-Apr-11', 20);
    INSERT INTO Ticker VALUES('ACME', '09-Apr-11', 24);
    INSERT INTO Ticker VALUES('ACME', '10-Apr-11', 25);
    INSERT INTO Ticker VALUES('ACME', '11-Apr-11', 19);
    INSERT INTO Ticker VALUES('ACME', '12-Apr-11', 15);
    INSERT INTO Ticker VALUES('ACME', '13-Apr-11', 25);
    INSERT INTO Ticker VALUES('ACME', '14-Apr-11', 25);
    INSERT INTO Ticker VALUES('ACME', '15-Apr-11', 14);
    INSERT INTO Ticker VALUES('ACME', '16-Apr-11', 12);
    INSERT INTO Ticker VALUES('ACME', '17-Apr-11', 14);
    INSERT INTO Ticker VALUES('ACME', '18-Apr-11', 24);
    INSERT INTO Ticker VALUES('ACME', '19-Apr-11', 23);
    INSERT INTO Ticker VALUES('ACME', '20-Apr-11', 22);
    

The following query uses row pattern matching to find all cases where stock
prices dipped to a bottom price and then rose. This is generally called a
V-shape. The resulting output contains only three rows because the query
specifies `ONE` `ROW` `PER` `MATCH`, and three matches were found.

    
    
    SELECT *
    FROM Ticker MATCH_RECOGNIZE (
         PARTITION BY symbol
         ORDER BY tstamp
         MEASURES STRT.tstamp AS start_tstamp,
                  LAST(DOWN.tstamp) AS bottom_tstamp,
                  LAST(UP.tstamp) AS end_tstamp
         ONE ROW PER MATCH
         AFTER MATCH SKIP TO LAST UP
         PATTERN (STRT DOWN+ UP+)
         DEFINE
            DOWN AS DOWN.price < PREV(DOWN.price),
            UP AS UP.price > PREV(UP.price)
         ) MR
    ORDER BY MR.symbol, MR.start_tstamp;
    
    SYMBOL     START_TST BOTTOM_TS END_TSTAM
    ---------- --------- --------- ---------
    ACME       05-APR-11 06-APR-11 10-APR-11
    ACME       10-APR-11 12-APR-11 13-APR-11
    ACME       14-APR-11 16-APR-11 18-APR-11

Partitioned Row Limiting in Non-Vector Context: Example

The following example finds the top two departments that people with highest
salary work in, and the top three people with the highest salary within each
selected department:

    
    
    SELECT deptno, ename FROM emp
    ORDER BY sal DESC
    FETCH FIRST 2 PARTITIONS BY deptno, 3 ROWS ONLY;

Partitioned Row Limiting in a Multi-Vector Search: Example

The following statement creates a table `chunk_table` with three columns:
`doc_id` and `chunk_id` (of type `NUMBER`), and `data_vec` (of type `VECTOR`).

`doc_id` refers to the document id, `chunk_id` refers to the chunk id, and
`data_vec` refers to the vector embedding.

    
    
    CREATE TABLE chunk_table ( 
      doc_id NUMBER, 
      chunk_id NUMBER, 
      data_vec VECTOR
     );

The following query performs a multi-vector search :

    
    
    SELECT doc_id,
      FROM chunk_table
      ORDER BY VECTOR_DISTANCE(data_vec, :query_vec)
      FETCH [APPROX] FIRST 10 PARTITIONS BY docId, 1 ROW ONLY;
