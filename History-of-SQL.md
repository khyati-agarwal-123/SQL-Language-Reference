## History of SQL

Dr. E. F. Codd published the paper, "A Relational Model of Data for Large
Shared Data Banks", in June 1970 in the Association of Computer Machinery
(ACM) journal, Communications of the ACM. Codd's model is now accepted as the
definitive model for relational database management systems (RDBMS). The
language, Structured English Query Language (SEQUEL) was developed by IBM
Corporation, Inc., to use Codd's model. SEQUEL later became SQL (still
pronounced "sequel"). In 1979, Relational Software, Inc. (now Oracle)
introduced the first commercially available implementation of SQL. Today, SQL
is accepted as the standard RDBMS language.
