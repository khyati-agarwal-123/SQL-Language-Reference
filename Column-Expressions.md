##  Column Expressions {#GUID-B16B2D82-5D4B-485B-AE20-160EC0C7137A} 

A column expression, which is designated as *column_expression* in subsequent syntax diagrams, is a limited form of *expr* . A column expression can be a simple expression, compound expression, function expression, boolean expression, or expression list, but it can contain only the following forms of expression: 

  * Columns of the subject table — the table being created, altered, or indexed 

  * Constants (strings or numbers) 

  * Deterministic functions — either SQL built-in functions or user-defined functions 




No other expression forms described in this chapter are valid. In addition, compound expressions using the ` PRIOR ` keyword are not supported, nor are aggregate functions. 

You can use a column expression for these purposes: 

  * To create a function-based index. 

  * To explicitly or implicitly define a virtual column. When you define a virtual column, the defining *column_expression* must refer only to columns of the subject table that have already been defined, in the current statement or in a prior statement. 




The combined components of a column expression must be deterministic. That is, the same set of input values must return the same set of output values.
