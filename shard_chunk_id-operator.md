## SHARD_CHUNK_ID Operator

You can use the SQL operator `SHARD_CHUNK_ID` to get the chunk ID in a
sharding environment. You must provide the table family ID and the sharding
key as input.

This operator can be used in all three sharding types: system, user-defined,
and composite. You can run the operator from the catalog and the shard.

Syntax

    
    
    SELECT SHARD_CHUNK_ID( table_family, sharding_key1 [, sharding_key2 ...]) FROM table_name ...

Semantics

`table_family`

The first operand `table_family` refers to the identifier of the table family.
It can be:

  * The table family id that can be queried from the `GSMADMIN_INTERNAL.TABLE_FAMILY` table, or 

  * The name of the root table in the form of `SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME` . 

If there is only one table family across the entire sharding environment,
`table_family` can take NULL as input. This will default to the existing
single table family.

`sharding_key`

The second operand `sharding_key` refers to a list of sharding keys. It can be
a constant value or column name.

You must order the list of sharding keys as follows:

  1. List of super-sharding keys in the order they are defined.
  2. List of sharding keys in the order they are defined. For this refer to `GSMADMIN_INTERNAL.SHARDKEY_COLUMNS` . 

In system and user-defined sharding environments, where super-sharding keys
are not used, you only need to supply sharding keys.

Example

Given the composite sharded table `customers` defined as follows:

    
    
    CREATE SHARDED TABLE customers (
        custno         NUMBER NOT NULL,
        name           VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
        signup         DATE DEFAULT NULL,
        class          VARCHAR2(3) NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT cust_pk PRIMARY KEY(custno,name))
    PARTITIONSET BY LIST (class)
    PARTITION BY CONSISTENT HASH (custno,name)
    PARTITIONS AUTO
    (PARTITIONSET gold VALUES ('gld') TABLESPACE SET tbs1,
     PARTITIONSET silver VALUES ('slv') TABLESPACE SET tbs2)
    ;

You can query it for the chunk ID with the following statement:

    
    
    SELECT SHARD_CHUNK_ID(null, class, custno, name) FROM customers;
