## About Queries and Subqueries

A query is an operation that retrieves data from one or more tables or views.
In this reference, a top-level `SELECT` statement is called a query, and a
query nested within another SQL statement is called a subquery.

This section describes some types of queries and subqueries and how to use
them. The top level of the syntax is shown in this chapter. Refer to
[SELECT](SELECT.md#GUID-CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6) for the full
syntax of all the clauses and the semantics of this statement.
