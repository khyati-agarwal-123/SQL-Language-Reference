[Description of the illustration trunc_date.eps](img_text/trunc_date.md)

Purpose

The `TRUNC` (datetime) function returns `date` with the time portion of the
day truncated to the unit specified by the format model `fmt`.

This function is not sensitive to the `NLS_CALENDAR` session parameter. It
operates according to the rules of the Gregorian calendar. The value returned
is always of data type `DATE`, even if you specify a different datetime data
type for date. If you do not specify the second argument `fmt`, then the
default format model â`DD`' is used and the value returned is `date`
truncated to the day with a time of midnight.

The `TRUNC` and `FLOOR` functions are synonymous for dates and timestamps.

Refer to "[CEIL, FLOOR, ROUND, and TRUNC Date Functions](ROUND-and-TRUNC-Date-
Functions.md#GUID-8E10AB76-21DA-490F-A389-023B648DDEF8)" for the permitted
format models to use in `fmt`.

Examples

The following example truncates a date:

    
    
    SELECT TRUNC(TO_DATE('27-OCT-92','DD-MON-YY'), 'YEAR')
      "New Year" FROM DUAL;
     
    New Year
    ---------
    01-JAN-92 

Formatting Dates using TRUNC: Examples

In the following example, the `TRUNC` function returns the input date with the
time portion of the day truncated as specified in the format model:

    
    
    WITH dates AS (   
      SELECT date'2015-01-01' d FROM dual union   
      SELECT date'2015-01-10' d FROM dual union   
      SELECT date'2015-02-01' d FROM dual union   
      SELECT timestamp'2015-03-03 23:45:00' d FROM dual union   
      SELECT timestamp'2015-04-11 12:34:56' d FROM dual    
    )   
    SELECT d "Original Date",   
           trunc(d) "Nearest Day, Time Removed",   
           trunc(d, 'ww') "Nearest Week", 
           trunc(d, 'iw') "Start of Week",   
           trunc(d, 'mm') "Start of Month",   
           trunc(d, 'year') "Start of Year"   
    FROM dates;
    

In the following example, the input date values are truncated and the
`TO_CHAR` function is used to obtain the minute component of the truncated
date values:

    
    
    WITH dates AS (   
      SELECT date'2015-01-01' d FROM dual union   
      SELECT date'2015-01-10' d FROM dual union   
      SELECT date'2015-02-01' d FROM dual union   
      SELECT timestamp'2015-03-03 23:45:00' d FROM dual union   
      SELECT timestamp'2015-04-11 12:34:56' d FROM dual    
    )   
    SELECT d "Original Date",   
           trunc(d) "Date with Time Removed",   
           to_char(trunc(d, 'mi'), 'dd-mon-yyyy hh24:mi') "Nearest Minute",   
           trunc(d, 'iw') "Start of Week",   
           trunc(d, 'mm') "Start of Month",   
           trunc(d, 'year') "Start of Year"  
    FROM dates;
    

The following statement alters the date format for the current session:

    
    
    ALTER SESSION SET nls_date_format = 'dd-mon-yyyy hh24:mi';

In the following example, the data is displayed in the new date format:

    
    
    WITH dates AS (   
      SELECT date'2015-01-01' d FROM dual union   
      SELECT date'2015-01-10' d FROM dual union   
      SELECT date'2015-02-01' d FROM dual union   
      SELECT timestamp'2015-03-03 23:44:32' d FROM dual union   
      SELECT timestamp'2015-04-11 12:34:56' d FROM dual    
    )   
    SELECT d "Original Date",   
           trunc(d) "Date, time removed",   
           to_char(trunc(d, 'mi'), 'dd-mon-yyyy hh24:mi') "Nearest Minute",   
           trunc(d, 'iw') "Start of Week",   
           trunc(d, 'mm') "Start of Month",   
           trunc(d, 'year') "Start of Year"   
    FROM dates;
