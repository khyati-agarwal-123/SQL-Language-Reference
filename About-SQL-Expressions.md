## About SQL Expressions

An expression is a combination of one or more values, operators, and SQL
functions that evaluates to a value. An expression generally assumes the data
type of its components.

This simple expression evaluates to 4 and has data type `NUMBER` (the same
data type as its components):

    
    
    2*2 
    

The following expression is an example of a more complex expression that uses
both functions and operators. The expression adds seven days to the current
date, removes the time component from the sum, and converts the result to
`CHAR` data type:

    
    
    TO_CHAR(TRUNC(SYSDATE+7)) 
    

You can use expressions in:

  * The select list of the `SELECT` statement 

  * A condition of the `WHERE` clause and `HAVING` clause 

  * The `CONNECT` `BY`, `START` `WITH`, and `ORDER` `BY` clauses 

  * The `VALUES` clause of the `INSERT` statement 

  * The `SET` clause of the `UPDATE` statement 

For example, you could use an expression in place of the quoted string
`'Smith'` in this `UPDATE` statement `SET` clause:

    
    
    SET last_name = 'Smith'; 
    

This `SET` clause has the expression `INITCAP`(`last_name`) instead of the
quoted string '`Smith`':

    
    
    SET last_name = INITCAP(last_name);
    

Expressions have several forms, as shown in the following syntax:

Oracle Database does not accept all forms of expressions in all parts of all
SQL statements. Refer to the section devoted to a particular SQL statement in
this book for information on restrictions on the expressions in that
statement.

You must use appropriate expression notation whenever `expr` appears in
conditions, SQL functions, or SQL statements in other parts of this reference.
The sections that follow describe and provide examples of the various forms of
expressions.
