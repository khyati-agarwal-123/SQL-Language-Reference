##  About SQL Expressions {#GUID-68789A5C-B142-496F-ADEE-837F75F95B2B} 

An  expression  is a combination of one or more values, operators, and SQL functions that evaluates to a value. An expression generally assumes the data type of its components. 

This simple expression evaluates to 4 and has data type ` NUMBER ` (the same data type as its components): 
    
    
    ```
    2*2 
    
    ```

The following expression is an example of a more complex expression that uses both functions and operators. The expression adds seven days to the current date, removes the time component from the sum, and converts the result to ` CHAR ` data type: 
    
    
    ```
    TO_CHAR(TRUNC(SYSDATE+7)) 
    
    ```

You can use expressions in: 

  * The select list of the ` SELECT ` statement 

  * A condition of the ` WHERE ` clause and ` HAVING ` clause 

  * The ` CONNECT ` ` BY ` , ` START ` ` WITH ` , and ` ORDER ` ` BY ` clauses 

  * The ` VALUES ` clause of the ` INSERT ` statement 

  * The ` SET ` clause of the ` UPDATE ` statement 




For example, you could use an expression in place of the quoted string ` 'Smith' ` in this ` UPDATE ` statement ` SET ` clause: 
    
    
    ```
    SET last_name = 'Smith'; 
    
    ```

This ` SET ` clause has the expression ` INITCAP ` ( ` last_name ` ) instead of the quoted string ' ` Smith ` ': 
    
    
    ```
    SET last_name = INITCAP(last_name);
    
    ```

Expressions have several forms, as shown in the following syntax: 

*expr* ::=

Oracle Database does not accept all forms of expressions in all parts of all SQL statements. Refer to the section devoted to a particular SQL statement in this book for information on restrictions on the expressions in that statement. 

You must use appropriate expression notation whenever *expr* appears in conditions, SQL functions, or SQL statements in other parts of this reference. The sections that follow describe and provide examples of the various forms of expressions.
