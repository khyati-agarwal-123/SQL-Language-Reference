## Backus-Naur Form Syntax

Each graphic syntax diagram in this reference is followed by a link to a text
description of the graphic. The text descriptions consist of a simple variant
of Backus-Naur Form (BNF) that includes the following symbols and conventions:

Symbol or Convention | Meaning  
---|---  
[ ] |  Brackets enclose optional items.  
{ } |  Braces enclose items only one of which is required.  
| |  A vertical bar separates alternatives within brackets or braces.  
...  |  Ellipsis points show that the preceding syntactic element can be repeated.  
delimiters |  Delimiters other than brackets, braces, vertical bars, and ellipses must be entered as shown.  
boldface |  Words appearing in boldface are keywords. They must be typed as shown. (Keywords are case-sensitive in some, but not all, operating systems.) Words that are not in boldface are placeholders for which you must substitute a name or value.
