## STATS_T_TEST_*

The t-test functions are:

  * `STATS_T_TEST_ONE`: A one-sample t-test 

  * `STATS_T_TEST_PAIRED`: A two-sample, paired t-test (also known as a crossed t-test) 

  * `STATS_T_TEST_INDEP`: A t-test of two independent groups with the same variance (pooled variances) 

  * `STATS_T_TEST_INDEPU`: A t-test of two independent groups with unequal variance (unpooled variances) 

Syntax

[Description of the illustration stats_t_test.eps](img_text/stats_t_test.md)

Purpose

The t-test measures the significance of a difference of means. You can use it
to compare the means of two groups or the means of one group with a constant.
Each t-test function takes two expression arguments, although the second
expression is optional for the one-sample function (`STATS_T_TEST_ONE`). Each
t-test function takes an optional third argument, which lets you specify the
meaning of the `NUMBER` value returned by the function, as shown in [Table
7-9](STATS_T_TEST_.md#GUID-B570D6F6-E4D7-4033-AC83-7E76F2E9CC2A__G1514103
"The first column lists the values you can specify for the argument of the
function and the second column explains the return value meanings."). For this
argument, you can specify a text literal, or a bind variable or expression
that evaluates to a constant character value. If you omit the third argument,
then the default is `'TWO_SIDED_SIG'`.

Table 7-9 STATS_T_TEST_* Return Values

Argument | Return Value Meaning  
---|---  
`'STATISTIC'` |  The observed value of t  
`'DF'` |  Degree of freedom  
`'ONE_SIDED_SIG'` |  One-tailed significance of t  
`'TWO_SIDED_SIG'` |  Two-tailed significance of t  
  
The two independent `STATS_T_TEST_`* functions can take a fourth argument
(`expr3`) if the third argument is specified as `'STATISTIC'` or
`'ONE_SIDED_SIG'`. In this case, `expr3` indicates which value of `expr1` is
the high value, or the value whose rejection region is the upper tail.

The significance of the observed value of t is the probability that the value
of t would have been obtained by chanceâa number between 0 and 1. The
smaller the value, the more significant the difference between the means. One-
sided significance is always respect to the upper tail. For one-sample and
paired t-test, the high value is the first expression. For independent t-test,
the high value is the one specified by `expr3`.

The degree of freedom depends on the type of t-test that resulted in the
observed value of t. For example, for a one-sample t-test
(`STATS_T_TEST_ONE`), the degree of freedom is the number of observations in
the sample minus 1.

### STATS_T_TEST_ONE

In the `STATS_T_TEST_ONE` function, `expr1` is the sample and `expr2` is the
constant mean against which the sample mean is compared. For this t-test only,
`expr2` is optional; the constant mean defaults to 0. This function obtains
the value of t by dividing the difference between the sample mean and the
known mean by the standard error of the mean (rather than the standard error
of the difference of the means, as for `STATS_T_TEST_PAIRED`).

STATS_T_TEST_ONE Example

The following example determines the significance of the difference between
the average list price and the constant value 60:

    
    
    SELECT AVG(prod_list_price) group_mean,
           STATS_T_TEST_ONE(prod_list_price, 60, 'STATISTIC') t_observed,
           STATS_T_TEST_ONE(prod_list_price, 60) two_sided_p_value
      FROM sh.products;
    
    GROUP_MEAN T_OBSERVED TWO_SIDED_P_VALUE
    ---------- ---------- -----------------
    139.545556 2.32107746        .023158537
    

### STATS_T_TEST_PAIRED

In the `STATS_T_TEST_PAIRED` function, `expr1` and `expr2` are the two samples
whose means are being compared. This function obtains the value of t by
dividing the difference between the sample means by the standard error of the
difference of the means (rather than the standard error of the mean, as for
`STATS_T_TEST_ONE`).

### STATS_T_TEST_INDEP and STATS_T_TEST_INDEPU

In the `STATS_T_TEST_INDEP` and `STATS_T_TEST_INDEPU` functions, `expr1` is
the grouping column and `expr2` is the sample of values. The pooled variances
version (`STATS_T_TEST_INDEP`) tests whether the means are the same or
different for two distributions that have similar variances. The unpooled
variances version (`STATS_T_TEST_INDEPU`) tests whether the means are the same
or different even if the two distributions are known to have significantly
different variances.

Before using these functions, it is advisable to determine whether the
variances of the samples are significantly different. If they are, then the
data may come from distributions with different shapes, and the difference of
the means may not be very useful. You can perform an f-test to determine the
difference of the variances. If they are not significantly different, use
`STATS_T_TEST_INDEP`. If they are significantly different, use
`STATS_T_TEST_INDEPU`. Refer to
[STATS_F_TEST](STATS_F_TEST.md#GUID-9E2A91FC-5BB3-449A-810C-DA6CB52B56ED)
for information on performing an f-test.

STATS_T_TEST_INDEP Example

The following example determines the significance of the difference between
the average sales to men and women where the distributions are assumed to have
similar (pooled) variances:

    
    
    SELECT SUBSTR(cust_income_level, 1, 22) income_level,
          AVG(DECODE(cust_gender, 'M', amount_sold, null)) sold_to_men,
          AVG(DECODE(cust_gender, 'F', amount_sold, null)) sold_to_women,
          STATS_T_TEST_INDEP(cust_gender, amount_sold, 'STATISTIC', 'F') t_observed,
          STATS_T_TEST_INDEP(cust_gender, amount_sold) two_sided_p_value
      FROM sh.customers c, sh.sales s
      WHERE c.cust_id = s.cust_id
      GROUP BY ROLLUP(cust_income_level)
      ORDER BY income_level, sold_to_men, sold_to_women, t_observed;
