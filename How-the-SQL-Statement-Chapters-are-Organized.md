## How the SQL Statement Chapters are Organized

All SQL statements in this book are organized into the following sections:

Syntax

The syntax diagrams show the keywords and parameters that make up the
statement.

Note:

Not all keywords and parameters are valid in all circumstances. Be sure to
refer to the "Semantics" section of each statement and clause to learn about
any restrictions on the syntax.

Purpose

The "Purpose" section describes the basic uses of the statement.

Prerequisites

The "Prerequisites" section lists privileges you must have and steps that you
must take before using the statement. In addition to the prerequisites listed,
most statements also require that the database be opened by your instance,
unless otherwise noted.

Semantics

The "Semantics" section describes the purpose of the keywords, parameters, and
clauses that make up the syntax, as well as restrictions and other usage notes
that may apply to them. (The conventions for keywords and parameters used in
this chapter are explained in the
"[Preface](Preface.md#GUID-0897B474-6033-4398-AA8A-922F1C5CAF53)" of this
reference.)

Examples

The "Examples" section shows how to use the various clauses and parameters of
the statement.
