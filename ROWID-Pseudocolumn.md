## ROWID Pseudocolumn

For each row in the database, the `ROWID` pseudocolumn returns the address of
the row. Oracle Database rowid values contain information necessary to locate
a row:

  * The data object number of the object

  * The data block in the data file in which the row resides

  * The position of the row in the data block (first row is 0)

  * The data file in which the row resides (first file is 1). The file number is relative to the tablespace.

Usually, a rowid value uniquely identifies a row in the database. However,
rows in different tables that are stored together in the same cluster can have
the same rowid.

Values of the `ROWID` pseudocolumn have the data type `ROWID` or `UROWID`.
Refer to [Rowid Data Types](Data-
Types.md#GUID-4231B94A-97E9-4B59-91EB-E7B2D0DA438C) and [UROWID Data
Type](Data-Types.md#GUID-E9F3AE1C-AA6D-4262-A15F-778833251361) for more
information.

Rowid values have several important uses:

  * They are the fastest way to access a single row.

  * They can show you how the rows in a table are stored.

  * They are unique identifiers for rows in a table.

You should not use `ROWID` as the primary key of a table. If you delete and
reinsert a row with the Import and Export utilities, for example, then its
rowid may change. If you delete a row, then Oracle may reassign its rowid to a
new row inserted later.

Although you can use the `ROWID` pseudocolumn in the `SELECT` and `WHERE`
clause of a query, these pseudocolumn values are not actually stored in the
database. You cannot insert, update, or delete a value of the `ROWID`
pseudocolumn.

Example

This statement selects the address of all rows that contain data for employees
in department 20:

    
    
    SELECT ROWID, last_name
      FROM employees
      WHERE department_id = 20;
