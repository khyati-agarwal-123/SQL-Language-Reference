## F  Extended Examples

The body of the SQL Language Reference contains examples for almost every
reference topic. This appendix contains lengthy examples that are not
appropriate in the context of a single SQL statement. These examples are
intended to provide uninterrupted the series of steps that you would use to
take advantage of particular Oracle functionality. They do not replace the
syntax diagrams and semantics found for each individual SQL statement in the
body of the reference. Use the cross-references provided to access additional
information, such as privileges required and restrictions, as well as syntax.

This appendix contains the following sections:

  * [Using Extensible Indexing](Using-Extensible-Indexing.md#GUID-BEAC690B-1FA4-4B31-9B28-FEAF45A01665)

  * [Using XML in SQL Statements](Using-XML-in-SQL-Statements.md#GUID-5FE21EC9-1F66-45F1-9FD8-ECA5336EDC14)
