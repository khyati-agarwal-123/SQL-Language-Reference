Purpose

`FIRST` and `LAST` are very similar functions. Both are aggregate and analytic
functions that operate on a set of values from a set of rows that rank as the
`FIRST` or `LAST` with respect to a given sorting specification. If only one
row ranks as `FIRST` or `LAST`, then the aggregate operates on the set with
only one element.

Refer to [FIRST](FIRST.md#GUID-85AB9246-0E0A-44A1-A7E6-4E57502E9238) for
complete information on this function and for examples of its use.
