## Oracle Compliance with SQL/XML

The XML data type in the standard is `XML`. The Oracle equivalent data type is
`XMLType`. A feature of the standard is considered to be fully supported if
the only difference between Oracle and the standard is the spelling of the
data type name.

[Table C-3](Oracle-Compliance-with-
SQLXML2011.md#GUID-0D0F19C8-0FB7-4FDD-A55B-18839F340E17__BJEGCHBH "The first
column lists the feature ID and the second column lists the feature name")
describes Oracle's support for the features of SQL/XML.

Table C-3 Oracle Support for Features of SQL/XML

Feature ID | Feature Support   
---|---  
X010, XML type |  Oracle fully supports this feature.  
X011, Arrays of XML types |  Oracle supports this feature using named array types  
X012, Multisets of XML type |  The Oracle equivalent of a multiset of XML type is a nested table with a single column of XML type.  
X013, Distinct types of XML |  A distinct type can be emulated using an object type with a single attribute.  
X014, Attributes of XML type |  In Oracle, attributes of object types may be of type `XMLType`, but the syntax for creating object types is nonstandard.   
X015, Fields of XML type |  Oracle object types may be used instead of row types; Oracle supports object types with attributes of `XMLType`.   
X016, Persistent XML values |  Oracle fully supports this feature.  
X020, `XMLConcat` |  Oracle fully supports this feature.  
X025, `XMLCast` |  Oracle supports this feature, with the following restrictions:

  * The source expression must be of `XMLType` and the target data type may not be `XMLType`. (Since Oracle has only one XML type, there is no need to cast from XML to XML.) 
  * Oracle does not support <XML passing mechanism>; the behavior is the same as `BY` `VALUE` in the standard. 

Oracle extends this feature with the ability to cast to type `REF` `XMLTYPE`.  
X031, `XMLElement` |  Oracle fully supports this feature.  
X032, `XMLForest` |  Oracle fully supports this feature.  
X034, `XMLAgg` |  Oracle fully supports this feature.  
X035, `XMLAgg`: `ORDER` `BY` option  |  Oracle fully supports this feature.  
X036, `XMLComment` |  Oracle fully supports this feature.  
X036, `XMLPi` |  Oracle fully supports this feature.  
X038, `XMLText` |  The Oracle `XMLCData` function may be used to create a text node.   
X040, Basic table mapping |  Oracle table mappings are available through a Java interface and through a package. Oracle table mappings have been generalized to map queries and not just tables. To map only a table: `SELECT` `*` `FROM` `table_name`. This provides support for the following elements of this feature: 

  * X041, Basic table mapping: null absent
  * X042, Basic table mapping: null as nil
  * X043, Basic table mapping: table as forest
  * X044, Basic table mapping: table as element
  * X045, Basic table mapping: with target namespace
  * X046, Basic table mapping: data mapping
  * X047, Basic table mapping: metadata mapping
  * X049, Basic table mapping: hex encoding

Oracle does not support the following element of this feature:

  * X048, Basic table mapping: base64 encoding

  
X041, Basic table mapping: null absent |  See X040.  
X042, Basic table mapping: null as nil |  See X040.  
X043, Basic table mapping: table as forest |  See X040.  
X044, Basic table mapping: table as element |  See X040.  
X045, Basic table mapping: with target namespace |  See X040.  
X046, Basic table mapping: data mapping |  See X040.  
X047, Basic table mapping: metadata mapping |  See X040.  
X049, Basic table mapping: hex encoding |  See X040.  
X060, `XMLParse`: Character string input and `CONTENT` option  |  Oracle does not support the {`PRESERVE` | `STRIP`} `WHITESPACE` syntax. The behavior is always `STRIP` `WHITESPACE`.   
X061, `XMLParse`: Character string input and `DOCUMENT` option  |  Oracle does not support the {`PRESERVE` | `STRIP`} `WHITESPACE` syntax. The behavior is always `STRIP` `WHITESPACE`.   
X069, `XMLSERIALIZE`: `INDENT` |  Oracle extends this feature with the ability to specify an indent size.  
X070, `XMLSerialize`: Character string serialization and `CONTENT` option  |  Oracle supports this feature, with this restriction:

  * In the standard, the choice of `DOCUMENT` or `CONTENT` is optional; in Oracle, you must specify one of these. 

Oracle extends this feature as follows: the standard requires a target data
type; Oracle defaults to `CLOB`.  
X071, `XMLSerialize`: Character string serialization and `DOCUMENT` option  |  Oracle fully supports this feature.  
X072, `XMLSerialize`: Character string serialization  |  Oracle fully supports this feature.  
X073, `XMLSerialize`: `BLOB` serialization and `CONTENT` option  |  Oracle fully supports this feature.  
X074, `XMLSerialize`: `BLOB` serialization and `DOCUMENT` option  |  Oracle fully supports this feature.  
X075, `XMLSerialize`: `BLOB` serialization  |  Oracle fully supports this feature.  
X076, `XMLSerialize`: `VERSION` option  |  Oracle fully supports this feature.  
X077, `XMLSerialize`: explicit `ENCODING` option  |  Oracle fully supports this feature.  
X080, Namespaces in XML publishing |  In the Oracle implementation of `XMLElement`, `XMLAttributes` are used to define namespaces (`XMLNamespaces` is not implemented). However, `XMLAttributes` is not supported for `XMLForest`.   
X086, XML namespace declarations in `XMLTable` |  Oracle fully supports this feature.  
X090, XML document predicate |  In Oracle, you can test whether an XML value is a document by using the `ISFRAGMENT` method.   
X096, `XMLExists` |  Oracle fully supports this feature, with this exception: Oracle only supports passing by value, so the keywords `BY` `VALUE` are optional at the beginning of the `PASSING` clause, and not supported on individual arguments.   
X120, XML parameters in SQL routines |  Oracle fully supports this feature.  
X121, XML parameters in external routines |  Oracle supports XML values passed to external routines using a non-standard interface.  
X141, `IS` `VALID` predicate: data drive case  |  The `XMLISVALID` method is equivalent to the `IS` `VALID` predicate, and supports the data-driven case.   
X142, `IS` `VALID` predicate: `ACCORDING` `TO` clause  |  The `XMLISVALID` method is equivalent to the `IS` `VALID` predicate, and includes the equivalent of the `ACCORDING` `TO` clause.   
X143, `IS` `VALID` predicate: `ELEMENT` clause  |  The `XMLISVALID` method is equivalent to the `IS` `VALID` predicate, and includes the equivalent of the `ELEMENT` clause.   
X144, `IS` `VALID` predicate: schema location  |  The `XMLISVALID` method is equivalent to the `IS` `VALID` predicate, and supports the specification of a schema location for a registered XML Schema.   
X145, `IS` `VALID` predicate outside check constraints  |  The `XMLISVALID` method is equivalent to the `IS` `VALID` predicate, and may be used outside check constraints.   
X151, `IS` `VALID` predicate with `DOCUMENT` option  |  The `XMLISVALID` method is equivalent to the `IS` `VALID` predicate, and performs validation equivalent to the `DOCUMENT` clause. (`XMLISVALID` does not support "content" validation.)   
X156, `IS` `VALID` predicate: optional `NAMESPACE` with `ELEMENT` clause  |  The `XMLISVALID` method is equivalent to the `IS` `VALID` predicate, and may be used to validate against an element in any namespace.   
X157, `IS` `VALID` predicate: `NO` `NAMESPACE` with `ELEMENT` clause  |  The `XMLISVALID` method is equivalent to the `IS` `VALID` predicate, and may be used to validate against an element in the "no name" namespace.   
X160, Basic Information Schema for registered XML Schemas |  The Oracle static data dictionary view `ALL_XML_SCHEMAS` provides a list of the registered XML schemas that are accessible to the current user. The `ALL_XML_SCHEMAS`.`SCHEMA_URL` column corresponds to the standard `XML_SCHEMAS`.`XML_SCHEMA_LOCATION` column. The target namespace of the registered XML Schemas can be learned by examining `ALL_XML_SCHEMAS`.`SCHEMA`. Oracle has no equivalents for the other columns of the standard's `XML_SCHEMAS`.   
X161, Advanced Information Schema for registered XML Schemas |  Oracle does not have static data dictionary views corresponding to `XML_SCHEMA_NAMESPACES` and `XML_SCHEMA_ELEMENTS` in the standard. However, all the information about registered XML Schemas may be learned by examining the actual XML Schema, which is found in the `ALL_XML_SCHEMAS`.`SCHEMA` column. This may also be examined to learn whether a registered XML Schema is nondeterministic, and which of its namespaces and elements are nondeterministic.   
X191, `XML`(`DOCUMENT` (`XMLSCHEMA`)) type  |  Oracle does not support this syntax. However, a column of a table can be constrained by a registered XML Schema, in which case all values of the column will be of `XML`(`DOCUMENT`(`XMLSCHEMA`)) type.   
X200, `XMLQuery` |  Oracle fully supports the following elements of this feature:

  * X201, `XMLQuery`: `RETURNING` `CONTENT`
  * X203, `XMLQuery`: passing a context item 
  * X204, `XMLQuery`: initializing an XQuery variable 
  * X206, `XMLQuery`: `NULL` `ON` `EMPTY` option 

Oracle only supports passing by value, so the keywords `BY` `VALUE` are
optional at the beginning of the `PASSING` clause, and not supported on
individual arguments.  
X201, `XMLQuery`: `RETURNING` `CONTENT` |  See X200.  
X203, `XMLQuery`: passing a context item  |  See X200.  
X204, `XMLQuery`: initializing an XQuery variable  |  See X200.  
X206, `XMLQuery`: `NULL` `ON` `EMPTY` option  |  See X200.  
X221, XML passing mechanism `BY` `VALUE` |  Oracle supports the `BY` `VALUE` clause in `XMLQuery`, `XMLTable` and `XMLExists`. In these, `BY` `VALUE` is supported as optional syntax at the beginning of an argument list, but not as a modifier on an individual argument or column.   
X232, `XML`(`CONTENT`(`ANY`)) type  |  Oracle does not support this syntax as a type modifier, but the Oracle `XMLType` supports this data type for transient values. Persistent values are of type `XML`(`DOCUMENT`(`ANY`)), which is a subset of `XML`(`CONTENT`(`ANY`)).   
X241, `RETURNING` `CONTENT` in XML publishing  |  Oracle does not support this syntax. In Oracle, the behavior of the publishing functions (`XMLAgg`, `XMLComment`, `XMLConcat`, `XMLElement`, `XMLForest`, and `XMLPi`) is always `RETURNING` `CONTENT`.   
X251, Persistent XML values of `XML`(`DOCUMENT`(`UNTYPED`)) type  |  Oracle fully supports this feature.  
X252, Persistent values of type `XML`(`DOCUMENT`(`ANY`))  |  Oracle fully supports this feature.  
X256, Persistent values of `XML`(`DOCUMENT`(`XMLSCHEMA`)) type  |  Oracle fully supports this feature.  
X260, XML type, `ELEMENT` clause  |  Oracle does not support this syntax. However, a column of a table may be constrained by a top-level element in a registered XML Schema.  
X263, XML type: `NO` `NAMESPACE` with `ELEMENT` clause  |  Oracle does not support this syntax. However, a column of a table may be constrained by a top-level element in the "no name" namespace of a registered XML Schema.  
X264, XML type: schema location |  Oracle does not support this syntax. However, a column of a table may be constrained by a registered XML Schema that is identified by a schema location.  
X271, XMLValidate: data driven case |  The `SCHEMAVALIDATE` method is equivalent to XMLValidate, and supports the data-driven case.   
X272, XMLValidate: `ACCORDING` `TO` clause  |  The `SCHEMAVALIDATE` method is equivalent to XMLValidate, and may be used to specify a particular registered XML Schema.   
X273, XMLValidate: `ELEMENT` clause  |  The `SCHEMAVALIDATE` method is equivalent to XMLValidate, and may be used to specify a particular element of a particular registered XML Schema.   
X274, XMLValidate: schema location |  The `SCHEMAVALIDATE` method is equivalent to XMLValidate, and may be used to specify a particular registered XML Schema by its schema location URL.   
X281, XMLValidate with `DOCUMENT` option  |  The `SCHEMAVALIDATE` method is equivalent to XMLValidate. `SCHEMAVALIDATE` performs validation only of XML documents (not content).   
X286, XMLValidate: `NO` `NAMESPACE` with `ELEMENT` clause  |  The `SCHEMAVALIDATE` method is equivalent to XMLValidate, and may be used to specify a particular element in the "no name" namespace of a particular registered XML Schema.   
X300, `XMLTable` |  Oracle does not support reverse axes in the column path expressions. Aside from that restriction, Oracle fully supports the following elements of this feature:

  * X086, XML namespace declarations in `XMLTable`
  * X302, `XMLTable` with ordinality column 
  * X303, `XMLTable`: column default option 
  * X304, `XMLTable`: passing a context item 
  * X305, `XMLTable`: initializing an XQuery variable 

Oracle only supports passing by value, so the keywords `BY` `VALUE` are
optional at the beginning of the `PASSING` clause, and not supported on
individual arguments.  
X302, `XMLTable` with ordinality column  |  See X300.  
X303, `XMLTable`: column default option  |  See X300.  
X304, `XMLTable`: passing a context item  |  See X300.  
X305, `XMLTable`: initializing an XQuery variable  |  See X300.
