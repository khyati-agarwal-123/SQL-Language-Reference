## Data Type Comparison Rules

The script content on this page is for navigation purposes only and does not
alter the content in any way.

This section describes how Oracle Database compares values of each data type.

### Numeric Values

A larger value is considered greater than a smaller one. All negative numbers
are less than zero and all positive numbers. Thus, -1 is less than 100; -100
is less than -1.

The floating-point value `NaN` (not a number) is greater than any other
numeric value and is equal to itself.

[Numeric Precedence](Data-
Types.md#GUID-4C0B65DB-E751-4957-A1ED-5044BAFA7812) and [Floating-Point
Numbers](Data-Types.md#GUID-F579F4B8-EF13-4CAF-9B06-03B076861C41) for more
information on comparison semantics

### Datetime Values

A later date or timestamp is considered greater than an earlier one. For
example, the date equivalent of '29-MAR-2005' is less than that of
'05-JAN-2006' and the timestamp equivalent of '05-JAN-2006 1:35pm' is greater
than that of '05-JAN-2005 10:09am'.

When two timestamps with time zone are compared, they are first normalized to
UTC, that is, to the timezone offset '+00:00'. For example, the timestamp with
time zone equivalent of '16-OCT-2016 05:59am Europe/Warsaw' is equal to that
of '15-OCT-2016 08:59pm US/Pacific'. Both represent the same absolute point in
time, which represented in UTC is October 16th, 2016, 03:59am.

### Binary Values

A binary value of the data type `RAW` or `BLOB` is a sequence of bytes. When
two binary values are compared, the corresponding, consecutive bytes of the
two byte sequences are compared in turn. If the first bytes of both compared
values are different, the binary value that contains the byte with the lower
numeric value is considered smaller. If the first bytes are equal, second
bytes are compared analogously, and so on, until either the compared bytes
differ or the comparison process reaches the end of one of the values. In the
latter case, the value that is shorter is considered smaller.

Binary values of the data type `BLOB` cannot be compared directly in
comparison conditions. However, they can be compared with the PL/SQL function
`DBMS_LOB`.`COMPARE`.

Reference](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-
database/23/sqlrf&id=ARPLS-GUID-A35DE03B-41A6-4E55-8CDE-77737FED9306) for more
information on the `DBMS_LOB`.`COMPARE` function

### Character Values

Character values are compared on the basis of two measures:

  * Binary or linguistic collation

  * Blank-padded or nonpadded comparison semantics

The following subsections describe the two measures.

Binary and Linguistic Collation

In binary collation, which is the default, Oracle compares character values
like binary values. Two sequences of bytes that form the encodings of two
character values in their storage character set are treated as binary values
and compared as described in [Binary Values](Data-Type-Comparison-
Rules.md#GUID-0F560FC8-3ADF-4AFD-87BA-E4673EFEE9FA). The result of this
comparison is returned as the result of the binary comparison of the source
character values.

See Also:

[Oracle Database Globalization Support
Guide](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-
database/23/sqlrf&id=NLSPG-GUID-BF26E01D-AB92-48FC-855A-69A5B3AF9A92) for more
information on character sets

For many languages, the binary collation can yield a linguistically incorrect
ordering of character values. For example, in most common character sets, all
the uppercase Latin letters have character codes with lower values than all
the lowercase Latin letters. Hence, the binary collation yields the following
order:

    
    
    MacDonald
    MacIntosh
    Macdonald
    Macintosh

However, most users expect these four values to be presented in the order:

    
    
    MacDonald
    Macdonald
    MacIntosh
    Macintosh

This shows that binary collation may not be suitable even for English
character values.

Oracle Database supports linguistic collations that order strings according to
rules of various spoken languages. It also supports collation variants that
match character values case- and accent-insensitively. Linguistic collations
are more expensive but they provide superior user experience.

See Also:

[Oracle Database Globalization Support
Guide](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-
database/23/sqlrf&id=NLSPG005) for more information about linguistic sorting

Restrictions for Linguistic Collations

Comparison conditions, `ORDER` `BY`, `GROUP` `BY` and `MATCH_RECOGNIZE` query
clauses, `COUNT(DISTINCT)` and statistical aggregate functions, `LIKE`
conditions, and `ORDER` `BY` and `PARTITION` `BY` analytic clauses generate
collation keys when using linguistic collations. The collation keys are the
same values that are returned by the function `NLSSORT` and are subject to the
same restrictions that are described in
[NLSSORT](NLSSORT.md#GUID-781C6FE8-0924-4617-AECB-EE40DE45096D).

Blank-Padded and Nonpadded Comparison Semantics

With blank-padded semantics, if the two values have different lengths, then
Oracle first adds blanks to the end of the shorter one so their lengths are
equal. Oracle then compares the values character by character up to the first
character that differs. The value with the greater character in the first
differing position is considered greater. If two values have no differing
characters, then they are considered equal. This rule means that two values
are equal if they differ only in the number of trailing blanks. Oracle uses
blank-padded comparison semantics only when both values in the comparison are
either expressions of data type `CHAR`, `NCHAR`, text literals, or values
returned by the `USER` function.

With nonpadded semantics, Oracle compares two values character by character up
to the first character that differs. The value with the greater character in
that position is considered greater. If two values of different length are
identical up to the end of the shorter one, then the longer value is
considered greater. If two values of equal length have no differing
characters, then the values are considered equal. Oracle uses nonpadded
comparison semantics whenever one or both values in the comparison have the
data type `VARCHAR2` or `NVARCHAR2`.

The results of comparing two character values using different comparison
semantics may vary. The table that follows shows the results of comparing five
pairs of character values using each comparison semantic. Usually, the results
of blank-padded and nonpadded comparisons are the same. The last comparison in
the table illustrates the differences between the blank-padded and nonpadded
comparison semantics.

Blank-Padded | Nonpadded  
---|---  
`'ac' > 'ab'` |  `'ac' > 'ab'`  
`'ab' > 'a '` |  `'ab' > 'a '`  
`'ab' > 'a' ` |  `'ab' > 'a' `  
`'ab' = 'ab'` |  `'ab' = 'ab'`  
`'a ' = 'a' ` |  `'a ' > 'a' `  
  
Data-Bound Collation

Starting with Oracle Database 12c Release 2 (12.2), the collation to use when
comparing or matching a given character value is associated with the value
itself. It is called the data-bound collation. The data-bound collation can be
viewed as an attribute of the data type of the value.

In previous Oracle Database releases, the session parameters `NLS_COMP` and
`NLS_SORT` coarsely determined the collation for all collation-sensitive SQL
operations in a database session. The data-bound collation architecture
enables applications to consistently apply language-specific comparison rules
to exactly the data that needs these rules.

Oracle Database 12c Release 2 (12.2) allows you to declare a collation for a
table column. When a column is passed as an argument to a collation-sensitive
SQL operation, the SQL operation uses the column's declared collation to
process the column's values. If the SQL operation has multiple character
arguments that are compared to each other, the collation determination rules
determine the collation to use.

There are two types of data-bound collations:

  * Named Collation: This collation is a particular set of collating rules specified by a collation name. Named collations are the same collations that are specified as values for the `NLS_SORT` parameter. A named collation can be either a binary collation or a linguistic collation. 

  * Pseudo-collation: This collation does not directly specify the collating rules for a SQL operation. Instead, it instructs the operation to check the values of the session parameters `NLS_SORT` and `NLS_COMP` for the actual named collation to use. Pseudo-collations are the bridge between the new declarative method of specifying collations and the old method that uses session parameters. In particular, the pseudo-collation `USING_NLS_COMP` directs a SQL operation to behave exactly as it used to behave before Oracle Database 12c Release 2. 

When you declare a named collation for a column, you statically determine how
the column values are compared. When you declare a pseudo-collation, you can
dynamically control comparison behavior with the session parameter `NLS_COMP`
and `NLS_SORT`. However, static objects, such as indexes and constraints,
defined on a column declared with a pseudo-collation, fall back to using a
binary collation. Dynamically settable collating rules cannot be used to
compare values for a static object.

The collation for a character literal or bind variable that is used in an
expression is derived from the default collation of the database object
containing the expression, such as a view or materialized view query, a PL/SQL
stored unit code, a user-defined type method code, or a standalone DML or
query statement. In Oracle Database 12c Release 2, the default collation of
PL/SQL stored units, user-defined type methods, and standalone SQL statements
is always the pseudo-collation `USING_NLS_COMP`. The default collation of
views and materialized views can be specified in the `DEFAULT` `COLLATION`
clause of the `CREATE` `VIEW` and `CREATE` `MATERIALIZED` `VIEW` statements.

If a SQL operation returns character values, the collation derivation rules
determine the derived collation for the result, so that its collation is
known, when the result is passed as an argument to another collation-sensitive
SQL operation in the expression tree or to a top-level consumer, such as an
SQL statement clause in a `SELECT` statement. If a SQL operation operates on
character argument values, then the derived collation of its character result
is based on the collations of the arguments. Otherwise, the derivation rules
are the same as for a character literal.

You can override the derived collation of an expression node, such as a simple
expression or an operator result, by using the `COLLATE` operator.

Oracle Database allows you to declare a case-insensitive collation for a
column, table or schema, so that the column or all character columns in a
table or a schema can be always compared in a case-insensitive way.

### Object Values

Object values are compared using one of two comparison functions: `MAP` and
`ORDER`. Both functions compare object type instances, but they are quite
different from one another. These functions must be specified as part of any
object type that will be compared with other object types.

See Also:

[CREATE TYPE](CREATE-TYPE.md#GUID-E72E3EE6-DE95-4F58-8941-E2F76D0EAE80) for
a description of `MAP` and `ORDER` methods and the values they return

### Varrays and Nested Tables

Comparison of nested tables is described in [Comparison
Conditions](Comparison-
Conditions.md#GUID-828576BF-E606-4EA6-B94B-BFF48B67F927).

### Data Type Precedence

Oracle uses data type precedence to determine implicit data type conversion,
which is discussed in the section that follows. Oracle data types take the
following precedence:

  * Datetime and interval data types

  * `BINARY_DOUBLE`

  * `BINARY_FLOAT`

  * `NUMBER`

  * Character data types

  * All other built-in data types 

### Data Conversion

Generally an expression cannot contain values of different data types. For
example, an expression cannot multiply 5 by 10 and then add 'JAMES'. However,
Oracle supports both implicit and explicit conversion of values from one data
type to another.

#### Implicit and Explicit Data Conversion

Oracle recommends that you specify explicit conversions, rather than rely on
implicit or automatic conversions, for these reasons:

  * SQL statements are easier to understand when you use explicit data type conversion functions.

  * Implicit data type conversion can have a negative impact on performance, especially if the data type of a column value is converted to that of a constant rather than the other way around.

  * Implicit conversion depends on the context in which it occurs and may not work the same way in every case. For example, implicit conversion from a datetime value to a `VARCHAR2` value may return an unexpected year depending on the value of the `NLS_DATE_FORMAT` parameter. 

  * Algorithms for implicit conversion are subject to change across software releases and among Oracle products. Behavior of explicit conversions is more predictable.

  * If implicit data type conversion occurs in an index expression, then Oracle Database might not use the index because it is defined for the pre-conversion data type. This can have a negative impact on performance.

#### Implicit Data Conversion

Oracle Database automatically converts a value from one data type to another
when such a conversion makes sense.

[Table 2-9](Data-Type-Comparison-
Rules.md#GUID-98BE3A78-6E33-4181-B5CB-D96FD9DC1694__G195937 "An X in a cell
indicates implicit conversion of the data types") is a matrix of Oracle
implicit conversions. The table shows all possible conversions, without regard
to the direction of the conversion or the context in which it is made.

The cells with an 'X' indicate the possible implicit conversions from source
to destination data type.

Footnote 1

You cannot convert `LONG` to `INTERVAL` directly, but you can convert `LONG`
to `VARCHAR2` using `TO_CHAR`(`interval`), and then convert the resulting
`VARCHAR2` value to `INTERVAL`.

Implicit Data Type Conversion Rules

  * During `INSERT` and `UPDATE` operations, Oracle converts the value to the data type of the affected column. 

  * During `SELECT` `FROM` operations, Oracle converts the data from the column to the type of the target variable. 

  * When manipulating numeric values, Oracle usually adjusts precision and scale to allow for maximum capacity. In such cases, the numeric data type resulting from such operations can differ from the numeric data type found in the underlying tables.

  * When comparing a character value with a numeric value, Oracle converts the character data to a numeric value.

  * Conversions between character values or `NUMBER` values and floating-point number values can be inexact, because the character types and `NUMBER` use decimal precision to represent the numeric value, and the floating-point numbers use binary precision. 

  * When converting a `CLOB` value into a character data type such as `VARCHAR2`, or converting `BLOB` to `RAW` data, if the data to be converted is larger than the target data type, then the database returns an error. 

  * During conversion from a timestamp value to a `DATE` value, the fractional seconds portion of the timestamp value is truncated. This behavior differs from earlier releases of Oracle Database, when the fractional seconds portion of the timestamp value was rounded. 

  * Conversions from `BINARY_FLOAT` to `BINARY_DOUBLE` are exact. 

  * Conversions from `BINARY_DOUBLE` to `BINARY_FLOAT` are inexact if the `BINARY_DOUBLE` value uses more bits of precision that supported by the `BINARY_FLOAT`. 

  * When comparing a character value with a `DATE` value, Oracle converts the character data to `DATE`. 

  * When you use a SQL function or operator with an argument of a data type other than the one it accepts, Oracle converts the argument to the accepted data type.

  * When making assignments, Oracle converts the value on the right side of the equal sign (=) to the data type of the target of the assignment on the left side.

  * During concatenation operations, Oracle converts from noncharacter data types to `CHAR` or `NCHAR`. 

  * During arithmetic operations on and comparisons between character and noncharacter data types, Oracle converts from any character data type to a numeric, date, or rowid, as appropriate. In arithmetic operations between `CHAR`/`VARCHAR2` and `NCHAR`/`NVARCHAR2`, Oracle converts to a `NUMBER`. 

  * Most SQL character functions are enabled to accept `CLOB`s as parameters, and Oracle performs implicit conversions between `CLOB` and character types. Therefore, functions that are not yet enabled for `CLOB`s can accept `CLOB`s through implicit conversion. In such cases, Oracle converts the `CLOB`s to `CHAR` or `VARCHAR2` before the function is invoked. If the `CLOB` is larger than 4000 bytes, then Oracle converts only the first 4000 bytes to `CHAR`. 

  * When converting `RAW` or `LONG` `RAW` data to or from character data, the binary data is represented in hexadecimal form, with one hexadecimal character representing every four bits of `RAW` data. Refer to "[RAW and LONG RAW Data Types](Data-Types.md#GUID-4FD497DD-3331-4C25-9147-3CEBEFDBFF22)" for more information. 

  * Comparisons between `CHAR` and `VARCHAR2` and between `NCHAR` and `NVARCHAR2` types may entail different character sets. The default direction of conversion in such cases is from the database character set to the national character set. [Table 2-10](Data-Type-Comparison-Rules.md#GUID-98BE3A78-6E33-4181-B5CB-D96FD9DC1694__G196434 "The first column shows the source data type and the header shows the destination data type. The cells show the result of the implicit conversion .") shows the direction of implicit conversions between different character types. 

Table 2-10 Conversion Direction of Different Character Types

SourceData Type | to CHAR | to VARCHAR2 | to NCHAR | to NVARCHAR2  
---|---|---|---|---  
`from CHAR` |  - |  `VARCHAR2` |  `NCHAR` |  `NVARCHAR2`  
`from VARCHAR2` |  `VARCHAR2` |  - |  `NVARCHAR2` |  `NVARCHAR2`  
`from NCHAR` |  `NCHAR` |  `NCHAR` |  - |  `NVARCHAR2`  
`from NVARCHAR2` |  `NVARCHAR2` |  `NVARCHAR2` |  `NVARCHAR2` |  -  
  
User-defined types such as collections cannot be implicitly converted, but
must be explicitly converted using `CAST` ... `MULTISET`.

#### Implicit Data Conversion Examples

Text Literal Example

The text literal '10' has data type `CHAR`. Oracle implicitly converts it to
the `NUMBER` data type if it appears in a numeric expression as in the
following statement:

    
    
    SELECT salary + '10'
      FROM employees;

Character and Number Values Example

When a condition compares a character value and a `NUMBER` value, Oracle
implicitly converts the character value to a `NUMBER` value, rather than
converting the `NUMBER` value to a character value. In the following
statement, Oracle implicitly converts '200' to 200:

    
    
    SELECT last_name
      FROM employees
      WHERE employee_id = '200';

Date Example

In the following statement, Oracle implicitly converts '`24-JUN-06`' to a
`DATE` value using the default date format '`DD-MON-YY`':

    
    
    SELECT last_name
      FROM employees 
      WHERE hire_date = '24-JUN-06';

#### Explicit Data Conversion

You can explicitly specify data type conversions using SQL conversion
functions. [Table 2-11](Data-Type-Comparison-
Rules.md#GUID-D0C5A47E-6F93-4C2D-9E49-4F2B86B359DD__G195600 "The first
column contains the source data types. The first row shows the destination
data types. The cells contain the bulit-in functions that can be used to
explicitly convert from each source data type to each destination data type.")
shows SQL functions that explicitly convert a value from one data type to
another.

You cannot specify `LONG` and `LONG` `RAW` values in cases in which Oracle can
perform implicit data type conversion. For example, `LONG` and `LONG` `RAW`
values cannot appear in expressions with functions or operators. Refer to
[LONG Data Type](Data-Types.md#GUID-F6309DF8-162F-48A4-9454-FEE59EC6644F)
for information on the limitations on `LONG` and `LONG` `RAW` data types.

### Security Considerations for Data Conversion

When a datetime value is converted to text, either by implicit conversion or
by explicit conversion that does not specify a format model, the format model
is defined by one of the globalization session parameters. Depending on the
source data type, the parameter name is `NLS_DATE_FORMAT`,
`NLS_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT`, or `NLS_TIMESTAMP_TZ_FORMAT`. The values of these
parameters can be specified in the client environment or in an `ALTER`
`SESSION` statement.

The dependency of format models on session parameters can have a negative
impact on database security when conversion without an explicit format model
is applied to a datetime value that is being concatenated to text of a dynamic
SQL statement. Dynamic SQL statements are those statements whose text is
concatenated from fragments before being passed to a database for execution.
Dynamic SQL is frequently associated with the built-in PL/SQL package
`DBMS_SQL` or with the PL/SQL statement `EXECUTE` `IMMEDIATE`, but these are
not the only places where dynamically constructed SQL text may be passed as
argument. For example:

    
    
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE
    'SELECT last_name FROM employees WHERE hire_date > ''' || start_date || '''';
    

where `start_date` has the data type `DATE`.

In the above example, the value of `start_date` is converted to text using a
format model specified in the session parameter `NLS_DATE_FORMAT`. The result
is concatenated into SQL text. A datetime format model can consist simply of
literal text enclosed in double quotation marks. Therefore, any user who can
explicitly set globalization parameters for a session can decide what text is
produced by the above conversion. If the SQL statement is executed by a PL/SQL
procedure, the procedure becomes vulnerable to SQL injection through the
session parameter. If the procedure runs with definer's rights, with higher
privileges than the session itself, the user can gain unauthorized access to
sensitive data.

on avoiding this security risk

Note:

This security risk also applies to middle-tier applications that construct SQL
text from datetime values converted to text by the database or by OCI datetime
functions. Those applications are vulnerable if session globalization
parameters are obtained from a user preference.

Implicit and explicit conversion for numeric values may also suffer from the
analogous problem, as the conversion result may depend on the session
parameter `NLS_NUMERIC_CHARACTERS`. This parameter defines the decimal and
group separator characters. If the decimal separator is defined to be the
quotation mark or the double quotation mark, some potential for SQL injection
emerges.
