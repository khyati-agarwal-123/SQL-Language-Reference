Purpose

`LNNVL` provides a concise way to evaluate a condition when one or both
operands of the condition may be null. The function can be used in the `WHERE`
clause of a query, or as the `WHEN` condition in a searched `CASE` expression.
It takes as an argument a condition and returns `TRUE` if the condition is
`FALSE` or `UNKNOWN` and `FALSE` if the condition is `TRUE`. `LNNVL` can be
used anywhere a scalar expression can appear, even in contexts where the `IS`
[`NOT`] `NULL`, `AND`, or `OR` conditions are not valid but would otherwise be
required to account for potential nulls.

Oracle Database sometimes uses the `LNNVL` function internally in this way to
rewrite `NOT` `IN` conditions as `NOT` `EXISTS` conditions. In such cases,
output from `EXPLAIN` `PLAN` shows this operation in the plan table output.
The `condition` can evaluate any scalar values but cannot be a compound
condition containing `AND`, `OR`, or `BETWEEN`.

The table that follows shows what `LNNVL` returns given that `a` = 2 and `b`
is null.

Condition | Truth of Condition | LNNVL Return Value  
---|---|---  
a = 1 |  `FALSE` |  `TRUE`  
a = 2 |  `TRUE` |  `FALSE`  
a `IS` `NULL` |  `FALSE` |  `TRUE`  
b = 1 |  `UNKNOWN` |  `TRUE`  
b `IS` `NULL` |  `TRUE` |  `FALSE`  
a = b |  `UNKNOWN` |  `TRUE`  
  
Examples

Suppose that you want to know the number of employees with commission rates of
less than 20%, including employees who do not receive commissions. The
following query returns only employees who actually receive a commission of
less than 20%:

    
    
    SELECT COUNT(*)
      FROM employees
      WHERE commission_pct < .2;
    
      COUNT(*)
    ----------
            11
    

To include the 72 employees who receive no commission at all, you could
rewrite the query using the `LNNVL` function as follows:

    
    
    SELECT COUNT(*)
      FROM employees
      WHERE LNNVL(commission_pct >= .2);
    
      COUNT(*)
    ----------
            83
