Syntax 

![Description of approx_count.eps follows](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/sqlrf/img/approx_count.gif)[ Description of the illustration approx_count.eps ](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/sqlrf/img_text/approx_count.md)

Purpose 

` APPROX_COUNT ` returns the approximate count of an expression. If you supply ` MAX_ERROR ` as the second argument, then the function returns the maximum error between the actual and approximate count. 

You must use this function with a corresponding ` APPROX_RANK ` function in the ` HAVING ` clause. If a query uses ` APPROX_COUNT ` , ` APPROX_SUM ` , or ` APPROX_RANK ` , then the query must not use any other aggregation functions. 

Examples 

The following query returns the 10 most common jobs within every department: 
    
    
    ```
    SELECT department_id, job_id, 
           APPROX_COUNT(*) 
    FROM   employees
    GROUP BY department_id, job_id
    HAVING 
      APPROX_RANK ( 
      PARTITION BY department_id 
      ORDER BY APPROX_COUNT(*) 
      DESC ) <= 10;
    ```
