## Scalar Subquery Expressions

A scalar subquery expression is a subquery that returns exactly one column
value from one row. The value of the scalar subquery expression is the value
of the select list item of the subquery. If the subquery returns 0 rows, then
the value of the scalar subquery expression is `NULL`. If the subquery returns
more than one row, then Oracle returns an error.

You can use a scalar subquery expression in most syntax that calls for an
expression (`expr`). In all cases, a scalar subquery must be enclosed in its
own parentheses, even if its syntactic location already positions it within
parentheses (for example, when the scalar subquery is used as the argument to
a built-in function).

Scalar subqueries are not valid expressions in the following places:

  * As default values for columns

  * As hash expressions for clusters

  * In the `RETURNING` clause of DML statements 

  * As the basis of a function-based index

  * In `CHECK` constraints 

  * In `GROUP` `BY` clauses 

  * In statements that are unrelated to queries, such as `CREATE` `PROFILE`
