##  CREATE ROLLBACK SEGMENT {#GUID-14AE3104-5B33-4E53-8E6F-6B2F037B52E9} 

> **note:** 

Oracle strongly recommends that you run your database in automatic undo management mode instead of using rollback segments. Do not use rollback segments unless you must do so for compatibility with earlier versions of Oracle Database. Refer to [ *Oracle Database Administrator's Guide* ](https://docs.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/sqlrf&id=ADMIN013) for information on automatic undo management. 

Purpose 

Use the ` CREATE ROLLBACK SEGMENT ` statement to create a  rollback segment  , which is an object that Oracle Database uses to store data necessary to reverse, or undo, changes made by transactions. 

The information in this section assumes that your database is not running in automatic undo mode (the ` UNDO_MANAGEMENT ` initialization parameter is set to ` MANUAL ` or not set at all). If your database is running in automatic undo mode (the ` UNDO_MANAGEMENT ` initialization parameter is set to ` AUTO ` , which is the default), then rollback segments are not permitted. However, errors generated in rollback segment operations are suppressed. 

Further, if your database has a locally managed ` SYSTEM ` tablespace, then you cannot create rollback segments in any dictionary-managed tablespace. Instead, you must either use the automatic undo management feature or create locally managed tablespaces to hold the rollback segments. 

> **note:** 

A tablespace can have multiple rollback segments. Generally, multiple rollback segments improve performance. 

  * The tablespace must be online for you to add a rollback segment to it. 

  * When you create a rollback segment, it is initially offline. To make it available for transactions by your Oracle Database instance, bring it online using the ` ALTER ROLLBACK SEGMENT ` statement. To bring it online automatically whenever you start up the database, add the segment name to the value of the ` ROLLBACK_SEGMENT ` initialization parameter. 




To use objects in a tablespace other than the ` SYSTEM ` tablespace: 

  * If you are using rollback segments for undo, then at least one rollback segment (other than the ` SYSTEM ` rollback segment) must be online. 

  * If you are running the database in automatic undo mode, then at least one ` UNDO ` tablespace must be online.

Prerequisites 

To create a rollback segment, you must have the ` CREATE ROLLBACK SEGMENT ` system privilege. 

Syntax 

*create_rollback_segment* ::= 

![Description of create_rollback_segment.eps follows](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/sqlrf/img/create_rollback_segment.gif)[ Description of the illustration create_rollback_segment.eps ](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/sqlrf/img_text/create_rollback_segment.md)( *storage_clause* ) 

Semantics 

PUBLIC 

Specify ` PUBLIC ` to indicate that the rollback segment is public and is available to any instance. If you omit this clause, then the rollback segment is private and is available only to the instance naming it in its initialization parameter ` ROLLBACK_SEGMENTS ` . 

*rollback_segment* 

Specify the name of the rollback segment to be created. The name must satisfy the requirements listed in  " [ Database Object Naming Rules ](Database-Object-Names-and-Qualifiers.md#GUID-75337742-67FD-4EC0-985F-741C93D918DA) "  . 

TABLESPACE 

Use the ` TABLESPACE ` clause to identify the tablespace in which the rollback segment is created. If you omit this clause, then the database creates the rollback segment in the ` SYSTEM ` tablespace. 

> **note:** 

Oracle Database must access rollback segments frequently. Therefore, Oracle strongly recommends that you do not create rollback segments in the ` SYSTEM ` tablespace, either explicitly or implicitly by omitting this clause. In addition, to avoid high contention for the tablespace containing the rollback segment, it should not contain other objects such as tables and indexes, and it should require minimal extent allocation and deallocation. 

To achieve these goals, create rollback segments in locally managed tablespaces with autoallocation disabled—in tablespaces created with the ` EXTENT MANAGEMENT LOCAL ` clause with the ` UNIFORM ` setting. The ` AUTOALLOCATE ` setting is not supported.

[ CREATE TABLESPACE ](CREATE-TABLESPACE.md#GUID-51F07BF5-EFAF-4910-9040-C473B86A8BF9)

*storage_clause* 

The *storage_clause* lets you specify storage characteristics for the rollback segment. 

  * The ` OPTIMAL ` parameter of the *storage_clause* is of particular interest, because it applies only to rollback segments. 

  * You cannot specify the ` PCTINCREASE ` parameter of the *storage_clause* with ` CREATE ROLLBACK SEGMENT ` .

Examples 

Creating a Rollback Segment: Example 

The following statement creates a rollback segment with default storage values in an appropriately configured tablespace: 
    
    
    ```
    CREATE TABLESPACE rbs_ts
       DATAFILE 'rbs01.dbf' SIZE 10M
       EXTENT MANAGEMENT LOCAL UNIFORM SIZE 100K;
    
    /* This example and the next will fail if your database is in 
       automatic undo mode.
    */
    CREATE ROLLBACK SEGMENT rbs_one
       TABLESPACE rbs_ts;
    
    ```

The preceding statement is equivalent to the following: 
    
    
    ```
    CREATE ROLLBACK SEGMENT rbs_one
       TABLESPACE rbs_ts
       STORAGE
       ( INITIAL 10K );
    ```
